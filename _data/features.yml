- name: <i class="fa fa-heart" style="color:white"></i> Needs
  description: An overwrought tool that ends up complicating the very task it's designed for. Seen as ridiculous by everyone but their user, for whom it fulfills a need they never knew they had.
  notes: that is, creates a need, an action, a function, an operation. Entries with the secondary tag `trivial` might be better classified as `need`?

- name: <i class="fa fa-bolt" style="color:white"></i> Wrinkle
  description: Names the means or technique of solving a problem rather than the tool employed. Can also be a non-material idea or concept, or a material demonstration of a scientific concept.
  notes: Can also be an invention, in that an invention is also an idea. Close or related to "wrinkle," but distinct from it in that a wrinkle is just a technique or a solution, the gadget actually involves a material solution, a tool.

- name: <i class="far fa-lightbulb" style="color:white"></i> Rig
  description: A tool rigged together on the fly, made from available materials lying around. A prototype or stopgap.
  notes: By the 30s (must be earlier?) these are "inventions" put together by "plucky" youths -- a kind of mythology over and against the complex networks of corporate and academic R&D at that point.  becomes closely related to tool category by the 40s, as most are trivialities rarely mass produced, submitted by magazine readers, etc. as curiosities.

- name: <i class="fa fa-tachometer-alt" style="color:white"></i> Gauge

- name: <i class="fa fa-wrench" style="color:white"></i> Tool
  description: A fully engineered, self-contained device or multitool, typically small, compact, utilitarian, and more often than not, inexpensive. Hand-powered and mechanical.
  notes: This gadget is usually some kind of labor-saving, often household, tool. In the 40s, becomes mainly a labor-saving, domestic device.  In the mid-40s into the 50s, "gadgets" used often to connote a large array of these labor-saving devices.  This sense of the term lends itself well to magazine pieces, and we see many full-page, image heavy spreads with many devices that help a particular activity--fishing, camping, photography, gardening, cooking. Often, an ingenious invention that is more than just cobbled together for a one-off purpose, like rig.

- name: <i class="fa fa-spinner fa-pulse" style="color:white"></i> Placeholder
  description: A word that substitutes for the forgotten or ignored proper name of any given object. A word that signifies miscellany; sundry objects.
  notes: Placeholders often refer to kitchen gadgets, later electronic gadgets. Specific types of random tools. should I just remove all "placeholder" tags from the graphs? It's not interesting when the word stands for anything at all, right? Because I'm looking for the contours of that thing. Theoretically, I should never just have a "placeholder" category.  Sure, it's a placeholder, but for WHAT KIND of object?
