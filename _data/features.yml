- name: <i class="fa fa-tachometer-alt" style="color:white"></i> Gauge
  description: An add-on, modification, accessory, or component displaying system status.
  notes: Orig. connected with automobiles, comes to be connected to planes, machine guns, gramophones, cameras, etc. as accessories that enhance the given technology in a certain way or provide an expedient to a process.  By the 30s, one can speak of a "gadget idea," as an addition that fulfills a particular purpose, one which isn't necessarily needed.

- name: <i class="far fa-lightbulb" style="color:white"></i> Rig
  description: Something rigged together on the fly.
  notes: By the 30s (must be earlier?) these are "inventions" put together by "plucky" youths -- a kind of mythology over and against the complex networks of corporate and academic R&D at that point.  becomes closely related to tool category by the 40s, as most are trivialities rarely mass produced, submitted by magazine readers, etc. as curiosities.

- name: <i class="fa fa-wrench" style="color:white"></i> Tool
  description: A fully engineered, self-contained device or multitool, usually small, compact, utilitarian, and more often than not, inexpensive.
  notes: In the 40s, becomes mainly a labor-saving, domestic device.  In the mid-40s into the 50s, "gadgets" used often to connote a large array of these labor-saving devices.  This sense of the term lends itself well to magazine pieces, and we see many full-page, image heavy spreads with many devices that help a particular activity--fishing, camping, photography, gardening, cooking.

- name: <i class="fa fa-spinner fa-pulse" style="color:white"></i> Placeholder
  description: A word that substitutes for the forgotten or ignored proper name of any given object.
  notes: Placeholders often refer to kitchen gadgets, later electronic gadgets. Specific types of random tools. should I just remove all "placeholder" tags from the graphs? It's not interesting when the word stands for anything at all, right? Because I'm looking for the contours of that thing. Theoretically, I should never just have a "placeholder" category.  Sure, it's a placeholder, but for WHAT KIND of object?

- name: <i class="fa fa-mobile-alt" style="color:white"></i> Portable
  description: A self-contained, electronic device such as a phone or radio.
  notes: More expensive than the previous, non-electronic category.  Originally any electronic or high-tech piece of equipment, but later comes to signify specifically hand-held, portable electronic equipment.  Initially, wireless sets beginning in the late 20s early 30s--as opposed to just accessories for those sets.  But very rare until… when, in the contemporary sense?  Check the wide tool category, may have missed some earlier, big handys waiting for hand-held versions…  OR… it's only a handy if it's hand-held and portable? Nixon's recording system referred to as a gadget… is that more of a placeholder, tool, or handy?  **HANDY. I think it has to do with signifying electronics. Nixon is bad with gadgets in that quote, which isn't just any old tool, but specifically electronic tools. Go back through tool/handy/placeholder to disambiguate.**
