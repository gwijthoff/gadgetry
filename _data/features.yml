# NOTES

# The closeness of `TOOL` and `PLACEHOLDER`: placeholder when you're refering
# to any obejct at all, tool when you're refering to a particular tool, like
# a popcorn machine, etc.
#
# 'HANDY' pre-smartphone: a hand-held or portable piece of electronic equipment,
# associated with media.
#
# More often than not, it's almost impossible to narrow the connotations down
# to a single meaning.

  description: An add-on, modification, or accessory.
  notes: Orig. connected with automobiles, comes to be connected to planes, machine guns, gramophones, cameras, etc. as accessories that enhance the given technology in a certain way or provide an expedient to a process.  By the 30s, one can speak of a "gadget idea," as an addition that fulfills a particular purpose, one which isn't necessarily needed.

- name: <i class="far fa-lightbulb" style="color:white"></i> Rig
  description: Something rigged together on the fly.
  notes: By the 30s (must be earlier?) these are "inventions" put together by "plucky" youths -- a kind of mythology over and against the complex networks of corporate and academic R&D at that point.  becomes closely related to tool category by the 40s, as most are trivialities rarely mass produced, submitted by magazine readers, etc. as curiosities.

- name: <i class="fa fa-wrench" style="color:white"></i> Tool
  description: A fully engineered, self-contained device or multitool, usually small, compact, utilitarian, and more often than not, inexpensive.
  notes: In the 40s, becomes mainly a labor-saving, domestic device.  In the mid-40s into the 50s, "gadgets" used often to connote a large array of these labor-saving devices.  This sense of the term lends itself well to magazine pieces, and we see many full-page, image heavy spreads with many devices that help a particular activity--fishing, camping, photography, gardening, cooking.

  description: A self-contained, electronic device such as a phone or radio.
  notes: More expensive than the previous, non-electronic category.  Originally any electronic equipment, but later comes to signify specifically hand-held, portable electronic equipment.  initially, wireless sets beginning in the late 20s early 30s--as opposed to just accessories for those sets.  But very rare until… when, in the contemporary sense?  Check the wide tool category, may have missed some earlier, big handys waiting for hand-held versions…
