- name: Rig
  description: Something rigged together on the fly.  by the 30s (must be earlier?) these are "inventions" put together by "plucky" youths -- a kind of mythology over and against the complex networks of corporate and academic R&D at that point.  becomes closely related to tool category by the 40s, as most are trivialities rarely mass produced, submitted by magazine readers, etc. as curiosities.

- name: Tool
  description: Fully engineered, self-contained device or multitool, usually small, compact, utilitarian, and more often than not, inexpensive.  In the 40s, becomes mainly a labor-saving, domestic device.  In the mid-40s into the 50s, "gadgets" used often to connote a large array of these labor-saving devices.  This sense of the term lends itself well to magazine pieces, and we see many full-page, image heavy spreads with many devices that help a particular activity--fishing, camping, photography, gardening, cooking.

- name: Portable
  description: piece of electronic equipment--phone, radio, etc.  More expensive than the previous, non-electronic category.  Originally any electronic equipment, but later comes to signify specifically hand-held, portable electronic equipment.  initially, wireless sets beginning in the late 20s early 30s--as opposed to just accessories for those sets.  But very rare until… when, in the contemporary sense?  Check the wide tool category, may have missed some earlier, big handys waiting for hand-held versions…
