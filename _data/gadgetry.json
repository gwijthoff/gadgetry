And although technological innovation antedates our species, it has never before occupied so great a share of man's energies.  /  Our works are built on old foundations––on obsolete inventions such as the hand-ax and the bow no less than on inventions that have survived, such as agriculture and the wheel.  But during most of human history technological art accumulated gradually.  Up to a few hundred years ago, the techniques of civilized life had scarcely advanced beyond the best achievements of the ancients.  Then our control over the forces of nature began to increase at an explosive rate.  […]  In this article we shall examine some recent advances to see what light they throw on the creative process in the complex of technology today.  What do we mean by technological innovation?  Surely not the tail fins on this year's automobile, nor a new catch on a refrigerator door.  A true innovation must perform some important function.  It may do a wholly new job or do an old job far better or far more cheaply than it was done before.  […]  …I will discuss some reasonably noncontroversial innovations made at the Bell Telephone Laboratories, where I am employed, under circumstances which I believe I understand.  […]  As our final example of innovation in technology let us consider briefly the microwave-relay system which carries telephone conversations and television programs across the country without the use of cables.  The key word here is 'system.'  The problem was not to make a particular device, but to weld a great number of devices into a complex whole.  Some of the deices were available at the start; others had to be developed.  But the chief innovation was the choice, among the many alternative methods and devices, of the best combination of methods and devices--the system as a whole, and not merely its adequate parts.  […]  [Harold T.] Friis's main problem, then, was not to invent this gadget or that, but to choose the best course, technically and economically, among a bewildering array of possibilities.  The art of making such a choice is usually called systems engineering when the alternative means and the required knowledge are all at hand.  When they are not, I suppose it should be called systems research.  By 1948 the results of the research of Friis and his colleagues had been embodied in an experimental system which was installed between New York and Boston.

In Stanhope's Demonstrator the middle term was represented by a small wooden panel called the \"holon.\" It had a frame through which other panels could be slid to cover all or part of the holon. A panel of gray wood, representing the subject, was pushed in from the left, and one of red glass, representing the predicate, was pushed in over this from the right.","author":"Gardner, Martin","title":"Logic Machines","source":"Scientific American 186, (March 1952). p. 68-73","notes":"","requires_revision":""},{"year":1952,"decade":1950,"primary":"handy","secondary":"","quote":"The waveguide is only one of many gadgets that microwaves have brought to radio.

Time magazine calls Flesch (as quoted on dustjacket) \"Mr. Fix-It of writing.\"  Language gadgets used to distinguish concrete words (\"apple\") from abstract ones (\"democracy\")?  * * * \"For language consists of two parts: the things we say and the machinery by which we say them.  To express our thoughts, as we have seen, we use sentences; and we cannot express a thought by any single word unless it is able to do the work of a sentence if necessary.  So we can tell the meaningful words apart from the mere language machinery by the sentence test: if a word can form a sentence, it refers to something outside language; if it cannot, it is just a language gadget. This has nothing to do with abstractness and concreteness: it is a linguistic difference.  For instance, the abstract word sin can be sued as a sentence, as in the famous answer to the question 'What was the sermon about?'  But the next question, 'What did the preacher say?' had to be answered by a whole sentence: 'He was against it.'  'Against' by itself wouldn't do as an answer; neither would dis- for 'He disapproved of it.'  That's because against and dis- are examples of language gadgets; they have no meaning except combined with meaningful words in a sentence.  /  Now, the point of all this is that difficult, complex, abstract language is cluttered up with gadgets.  If we stick to this purely linguistic test, we can measure difficulty by counting gadgets, and we can simplify out speech and writing by throwing them out.  /  Language gadgets, as you have seen, are of two kinds: words by themselves, like against, and parts of words (Affixes), like dis-.  The more harmful of the two for plain talk are the affixes, since the reader or hearer cannot understand what the gadget does to the sentence before he has disentangled it from the word it is attached to.  Each affix burdens his mind with two jobs: first, he has to split up the word into tis parts and, second, he has to rebuild the sentence from these parts.  To do this does not even take a split second, of course; but it adds up\"","author":"Flesch, Rudolf Franz","title":"Gadgets of Language","source":"The Art of Plain Talk.  Harper & Brother: 1946.","notes":" Foreword by Lyman Bryson, educational director of CBS.  The book apparently builds on \"scientific studies in the psychology of verbal communication\" which have \"made advances in finding out what readers get, and what they do not get, out of looking at black marks on a white page\" (ix).  In Bryson's introduction, he shudders at the thought of the millions who don't read \"And yet these people, millions of them, vote and run machinery and handle the dangerous gadgets of a civilization of which they understand very little\" (ix).  * * * Gadgets of language can make one more critically and culturally aware of the more dangerous industrial gadgets one uses every day.  Intro to Flesch's next book written by Alan J. Gould, Executive Editor of The Associated Press.  \"The rapidity with which Doctor Flesch has achieved results on the American writing scene is due, I suggest, to two main factors: (a) his own skill in presenting a novel formula for measuring Readability, and (b) the extent to which it has been applied effectively to news writing.  A Flesch axiom--'Write as you talk'--is now widely accepted by newspapermen who scoffed at the doctor's ideas when they began emerging from collegiate classrooms\" (x).  Flesch as a language and writing guru, who has a run in with another media guru, McLuhan.  McLuhan cites it in The Mechanical Bride?  \"The Art of Plain Talk is not a grammar nor a volume of 'usage.'  It is not a rehash of vague generalities…\"  around p. 41-42 in McLuhan.  Flesch follows this up with The Art of Readable Writing, in 1949(?), stating goal of his early book was \"to popularize the concept of readability.\" ","requires_revision":""},{"year":1955,"decade":1950,"primary":"language","secondary":"cybernetics;patent","quote":"I do have some familiarity with modern high speed computing devices and other optical-electronic-mechanical techniques for handling information; and I have had some contacts with--and surely a lively interest in--the recent developments of communication theory\" (613).  The \"patent office problem\" is, to Weaver, \"a fascinating instance of a rather common modern dilemma, namely, the essential collapse of a communication network due to over-complication; or somewhat more precisely, due to the use of an outmoded procedure which is not capable of coping with the presently existing degree of complication.  This is, in fact, a dramatic instance of the situation not uncommon in the general world of scholarship, in which a vast and intricate tangle of documents gets jammed into an unusable pile between two minds\" (613).  \"There are slightly less than three million U.S. Patents.  If we add the foreign patents and the items of technical literature available in the Patent Office, the total swells to about seven million.  The corresponding figure was only 1.2 million in 1900; and the patents of today average about one-third longer, and are certainly much more complex in their technical and scientific detail.  In the terminology of modern communications theory, in which a 'bit' of information is the basic unit (essentially the answer to a single 'Yes-No' question), the total amount of information which must today be dealt with in the Patent office has been estimated to be of the order of fifty billion bits [CONVERT 50 BILLION BITS TO GB?  1 million GB?  =  1,000 TB?] (614).  Goes on to survey different kinds of \"mechanical aids to data handling.\"  /  A question of classification -- beginning to work out the dimensions of a relational database:  \"When does a Document A exhibit inhibitory relevance to another Document B?\" (619).  * * * Is it unreasonable to think that, if one just looks deep enough with trained and observant eyes, he might see an inner logical simplicity behind all the confusing proliferation of things and ideas that turn up in the Patent Office?  Just because of its emphasis on inner logical simplicity, and on generality to encompass multiplicity, the point of view of mathematics would seem to be the promising one here.  How, for example, does one ever define 'containers' in the everyday nouns and adjectives of commerce in a way which is at once simple enough, general enough, and critical enough so that can possibly cope with the gadgets someone will think of tomorrow?  But what object can anyone ever think up that will not be subject to the basic inner concepts of connectivity as they are developed in topology?\" (621-2)  Biological metaphor for an \"organic sort\" of classification system, \"For it must be able to grow and to adjust itself to an ever changing environment.\"  (622).  \"I realize that I have succeeded in defining, in impersonal terms, Professor John von Neumann; and I also realize that the Atomic Energy Commission has him all booked up at the moment.

You get your pay when you can step aside and watch them function automatically, with a self-satisfied grin on your face.  Who cares about time, anyway.  /  Top-flight position as Public Gadgeteer No. 1 undoubtedly has now been won by Kenneth Richter, 33 Clarence Ave., Bridgewater, Mass, whose star camera works while he sleeps.  It is in storage just now, as Richter is away at Harvard and in summer is running a \"Chromocinemataudiographic Expedition, Ltd.' (possibly 'limited' refers to the funds) somewhere between hudson Bay and the N. Pole.  Nevertheless we invited him to remove the bushel from off its light, so the rest of us could see its glimmer.  /  \"The desire for the instrument was born of the fact that we have but two seasons in Bridgewater-the cold sea­ son and the mosquito season, and both are too uncomfortable for visual guiding of an astronomical camera. There­fore, about a year's work was spent overcoming the discomfort of attend­ ing the camera throughout the night­ the exposure is made automatically.  /  At about dark, I go out, lift the cover off the instrument, and pull out the plate holder slide against a stop. Next, I go in and set a clock by my bedside for the time I want the exposure to start, also for the length of time it is to run. Then I work on a mirror, take the girl friend to a movie (though building the thing kept me so broke that this is just wishful thinking) or I go to bed.  /  At, say, 2 A.M., the clock turns on the power.  Outside, the camera springs to life. A small motor swings the flap shutter open, and an electro­ magnet holds it thereafter when the small motor has shut itself off by breaking its own circuit just as the shutter strikes the magnet. The latter is energized by a radio 'A' eliminator, to avoid the vibration of the camera that would result from the use of an A.C. magnet. This is a satis­ factory source of 6-v., D.C., well filtered. Meanwhile a synchronous motor drive, using one of the hen's-teeth 4-watt Warren motors, has started to apply the diurnal motion.  […]  While almost all the gadgets are simple enough to be foolproof in operation, the drive frequently messes up the work.  Other than that, one might say that it saves me probably 2 hours' work a week.  The number of hours required to build the machine would, of course, swallow up this saving for several years.

'They are gadget-minded.  If they see a thing that needs to be done, they rig up a device, mechanical or mental, and make the thing do itself with no further bother.'  /  'As a result,' he goes on,' they have created a touch-the-button civilization, and I for one admire it.  Why go on doing a thing in the same old way, over and over again, if we can make a robot do it for us, and do it better?  My hat is of to the gadget mind.'  /  To prove his point he refers to the Mark Twain story of the Connecticut Yankee at the Court of King Arthur.  The Yankee saw a saint swaying to and fro in an ecstasy of devotion, and to him it was a clear case of lost motion.  So he sat about and invented a device by which to harness the saint and use his motions to run a sewing machine.  In other words, he put religion to a practical use.  /  But, my friend goes on to say, there are some fields in which the gadget mind will not work; and here he gets under our skin a bit.  We tried to achieve temperance by prohibition, and it failed.  We passed the law, wrote it into the Constitution and thought that the thing was done, and would stay done, or else would go on doing itself.  /  In the same way, he adds--rubbing it in rather sharply--we proposed the Pact of Paris; just another glorious gadget.  We wrote a law outlawing war, renouncing it as a policy of nations.  The Law was solemnly signed; an dew thought the thing was done once for all.  But, alas, we see now that much remains to be done before war is ended.  /  In other words, my friend argues rightly, something more than a gadget mind is needed to deal with the issues now before mankind.  It cannot be done by a twist of the wrist or the turn of a trick, much less by touching a button.  We need vision, and the courage, wisdom and patience to work it out, though it may take a long time.  /  Yes, the gadget mind is useful in its place; it can do many things.

But so, apparently, is civilization [gallows humor in the lead-up to war…].  And in case our publication date does not succeed in anticipating the final crash of Armageddon, we would like to give you a few hints of what these volumes would have contained.  /  Everybody knows what a gadget is, and yet a definition is hard to find.  After deep thought, we givey ou this:  A gadget is anything which, designed to simplify life, actually complicates it.  We are fully aware that this definition is almost revolutionary in its comprehensiveness.  Yet it is tenable.  It includes everything from a battleship to a fountain pen.  It includes the cigarette lighter that is always running dry, the electric icebox that springs a sulphur leak when eight guests are waiting for cocktails, the automatic shocke that saves two seconds in starting your car every day for thirty days, and on the thirty-first robs you of two hours of your time and two dollars of your money.  It includes most of the things you give your friends for Christmas, And [sic] all that you get.  /  In our chapter on Man and the Gadget, we show how man, the eternal sucker, progresses from enthusiasm to disillusion, repeatedly, all his life long--for the gadget has no experience value.  Elsewhere we estimate the time and money spent on the invention, manufacture, sale, operation, and final frenzied destruction of gadgets.  We list al known gadgets, showing the difference between promise and performance.  And finally, we paint a picture of a gadget-less Utopia, with a few practical hints on how to attain it.  /  The difficulty in completing this work has been in our gadget-testing department.  For obviously, if a single gadget is really found to simplify life, it nullifies our whole argument.  And new gadgets appear daily.  We were ready this morning to write finis--when we read of the new false teeth plates which have magnets set in them, with like poles opposing, to keep upper and lower plates apart and in place.  We have always insisted on doing all testing ourself.  Yet we still retain most of our original teeth, and are reluctant to sacrifice them, even to add the final proof to our theory.  For if the magnets don't work, we have, it is true, the proof, but are just where we were before, and with nothing to chew with.

This peculiar form of gadgetry is aimed right at the women, and in the hands of capable workers, it hardly ever misses its mark.  /  During good times and bad there has always been a call for gadgets.  They make their mark, last in popularity for a cycle of three years, more or less, then seemingly die as quickly as they were born.  But this is more a hibernation than death, since in kitchen gadgetry as in many other merchandising fields, old objects are frequently born over again and ride high on a new wave of popularity.  /  For example: 20 years ago a big item on boardwalks was the combination peeler-slicer, which both peeled and cored fruit such as apples, as well as scoring corn and being useful as a slicer.  That was 20 years ago, and it's on the scene again.  /  For example:  Three years ago, choppers became a hot item, starting with a Swiss import retailing at $1.98.  American versions, like Rotomatic and Chopomatic, competed with the Swiss Blitzhacker.  Price was $2.98.  Mass production overtook the price and stamped it down to $1.98 and even lower in some cases, causing some perplexity by price-conscious demonstrators.  Rotomatic was replaced by the Imperial Food Chopper during this period.  But this price confusion was followed by a waning popularity and it was decided to produce a super model with a bigger bowl, capable of holding more and bigger vegetables and eliminating the need to slice some of them down to chopper size.

It would improve the level of the demonstration industry and protect it from space rent and percentage gouging.  /  The person working gadgets is all things to all viewers, wherever the public congregates.  If they want humor he has it; the same goes for the many other qualities necessary to successful entertainment on a personnel level.  It is so personal, in fact, that unlike high paid public performers, the gadget worker's immediate audience rarely numbers more than three dozen people and is no more than 12 feet from him.  If he is a top-notcher, however, he could get 75 per cent of his tip (audience) to vote him into Congress as easily as spring (spend) for a sale.  /  Basically speaking, the new and novel item is a traffic-stopper, enabling the demonstrator to build his tip.  He presents it in a [sic] appealing way through humor, stories, etc., hooding his tip's attention while presenting the item.  Then comes his close (windup) and the request for sales.  Then comes a rehash of his spiel to convince additional viewers who have not sprung and also to hold the tip, which in itself is a good way to stop more traffic as passers-by gather to see what's going on.  /  The business is a small one and far from the usual housewares salesmanship.  It has workers (commission agents) who act for the leaders, those pace-setters in the field.  There are independents, who do their own buying and renting of space, and who work alone except for an occasional partner or member of the family.  /  The field's code of ethics is not one that a banker would follow.

One can say that it is similar to a secondary process operation which takes the unorganized and gives it organization. In most cases a human being is required to operate machines. The gadget differs from the complex machine in that it minimizes the importance of the human being whereas the ordinary machine augments a person's capacity to do work which requires secondary process operations. For example, typewriting is the use of a machine to record ideas which are refined and organized in the process of transmitting them to the machine. The typewriter is thus a mechanical aid to the secondary process operation. The gadget, on the other hand, requires a minimum of human intervention and gives the illusion of operating independently.  /  One cannot conceive of a machine performing secondary process operations independently, because in order to accomplish such a function there must also be a primary process. There are, however, a variety of electronic computers that seem almost to be able to think. Cybernetics, as we all know, has viewed the psychic apparatus in terms analogous to those of an electronic circuit and has caused machines to be built that function in a manner that is analogous to human logic.  /  Both patients stressed that the function of a gadget is secondary in importance to its operation, which obscured its purpose to them. Whether it worked or not, in terms of accomplishing what it is supposed to do, was a minor consideration. This does not mean that the gadget did not have to work perfectly in a mechanical sense, because if it did not the gadgeteer would be frustrated. What it did mean, to both the patients, was that the human appreciation of what the gadget accomplishes, for example, reproduction of music in such a way as to provide a gratifying and moving experience, tended to take second place in their minds to a pleasure in the operation of the gadget itself.\" (336).  \"Common among all the patients in this group was anger toward the gadget and the 'gadgeteer'. To define these terms for the purpose of this paper is not easy. Any technological device, especially when first introduced, can be considered a gadget. These patients for the most part objected to two aspects of these devices which may be classified as follows. First, the regulation of time as in switches with either an automatic control or a feed-back mechanism to interrupt a circuit and turn something off or on. Included were such items as furnace controls, coffee makers, and radio switches that turn other mechanisms on and off. Second, enhancement of passivity. In this class can be included practically all objects that do work, and consequently permit more leisure. Automatic dishwashers, automatic transmissions in automobiles, and, especially, remote control of television without getting up from one's armchair are a threat because of the enhancement of passivity.  Television itself was scorned by one patient who nevertheless succumbed to its lure and then watched it for hours every night. One patient was particularly chagrined to learn there was a switch that automatically controls a fan for ventilating a house, depending on the amount of heat in the attic. That it required a minimum of human intervention for its operation was what this patient found most disturbing.  /  This classification is sketchy and not technologically precise. As it is manifestly impossible to state definitely where invention ends and gadgeteering begins, it is striking that these patients frequently made such arbitrary distinctions. Patients pointed out that function was of little importance; the operation of the gadget was the primary feature. One patient spoke with anger of persons who were more interested in the tonal qualities of complex high fidelity sets than in the music. He referred to a recent joke of a person who contented himself with studying the wave patterns produced by an oscillograph hooked into the system.\"  (330)  Catalogues patients who can only appreciate photographs and not painting for instance, appreciating technical perfection over beauty.  \"In these instances, it is the person who is ingenious, not the machine; and such a person strives to be capable of accomplishing almost anything. The omnipotent qualities of such fantasies are extremely valuable in enhancing narcissism. Such a fantasy, especially when it is as compulsive as it was in both these patients, serves as a narcissistic, omnipotent, magical defense against the inner awareness of a weak and constricted ego\" (339).  \"To this artist, as it was to the scientist, the gadget served as an intensive means of communicating with reality.\"  \"In both these patients, the gadget was not only a factor that represented the operation of the secondary process, which is in opposition to instinctual forces, but, more specifically, it was a factor in preserving identity. In the first case, there was a direct correlation between the patient's interest in gadgets and security in his identity. In the second case, there seemed to be an inverse correlation; greater preoccupation with the gadget threatened the patient's ego ideal, and made him feel less secure of his identity.","author":"Giovacchini, Peter L.","title":"On Gadgets","source":"Psychoanalytic Quarterly.  28: 330-341.  1959","notes":"","requires_revision":"multiple quotes"},{"year":1959,"decade":1950,"primary":"tool","secondary":"bomb","quote":"Pascual now is claiming for himself a new attitude.

He invented the widger, its name, and the verb to wig, which, although not exactly onomatopoeic, suggests very successfully the action of prising up--you wig up a weed, or wig up a caked bit of soil for the purpose of aerating it--all very necessary operations which before the arrival of the widget were sometimes awkward to perform.

Again our lexicographer, rating the word as colloquial, one step higher than slang, describes it as 'a curious or ingenious notion; happy thought.'  I will accept that phrase 'happy thought' as particularly pat.  But to the seaman, a gadget is a thing, and a wrinkle is a method, and both of them for most part unusual and unstandardized.\" (viii))  /  That a gadget is a solution that arises naturally out of the materials of the ship -- similar to distinction made in US Court of Appeals case on the difference between a gadget and an invention:  \"In the long centuries in which men have sailed the seas, they have faced and solved oft-recurring problems.  When these problems present themselves on every passage and on every tack, the means of solving them are built right into the ship or her rigging.  ut when, as so often occurs, the problem arises out of some unusual situation, the sailor is forced to turn inventor.  He calls upon all his ingenuity.  He summons to his aid his past experience with the solution of some similar problem.  And perhaps he remembers, with that strange race memory which is often mis-called instinct, some similar experience of a sea-going ancestor.\"  /  \"Our lexicographers define a gadget as 'anything the name of which cannot be recalled at the moment,' and in parentheses, they add (Slang, U.S. Navy.)  But the name has a broader meaning and a riper antiquity than the dictionary credits.  I believe the term is older than the navy itself, ad far too deeply imbedded in the language to merit the transitory stigma of slang.  A landsman's synonyms for gadget are thing-um-bob, widget, what-do-yer-call-it, do-funny.  A sailor's synonym is gilhickey, although a purist would make a distinction by never using the term gilhickey except to distinguish one gadget from another.  The first gadget is the gadget.  The second gadget in any situation in which two appear is the gilhickey.\"  (viii)  /  The temporality/longevity/life-span of a gadget--\"But it must not be considered that the term is applied merely as a temporary substitute for an object's true name.  Most of the unusual things about a ship go nameless forever.  When an invention becomes so standardized that it acquires a name, it ceases to be a gadget except for those brief periods when its distinguishing name is forgotten.  But there are thousands of unusual things about a ship or a yacht that were born gadgets and will remain gadgets as long as they are used.  They are the inventions that solve the rare problems, the machines that are unnecessary on most vessels and at most times and are therefore nameless.\" That at any moment, a gadget could become a wrinkle and vice versa--the difference between a tool and a procedure is not readily identifiable:  \"I have been sore put to it to organize this book.  For I am dealing with concepts that have thus far resisted organization so well that they have avoided being tagged with names.  Also it is pretty hard to tell where a gadget begins and a wrinkle ends or vice versa.  Take a familiar example.  You are about to tie two lines together.  You tie them into a weaver's knot.  Standard practice so far--no gadgets, no wrinkles.  The nrealizing that ther eis going to be a terrific strain on that line and that the knot will be pulled so tight that you will never be able to untie it again, you decide to slip a toggle into the knot.  That's a happy thought, for you can always take a hammer and drive out the toggle and the knot will be loose.  What is that toggle--a winkle or a gadget?  Now suppose we decide that the strain is going to be so great that it will be difficult to drive out an ordinary toggle.  So we use a large fid whose sloping shape assures us that the slightest driving with the hammer will loosen the knot.  Is the wrinkle now a gadget?  Or if the small end of the fid is greased to make it slip more easily through the the tight turns of the knot, does it become a wrinkle again?  I don't know and I don't pretend to try to find out.  The line of demarkation is too indistinct.  So I shall write about gadgets and wrinkles without worrying much about branding them with their proper names.","author":"Calahan, Harold Augustin","title":"","source":"Gadgets and Wrinkles:  A Compendium of Man's Ingenuity at Sea.  1938.

The trial court upheld validity, found and enjoined infringement, and ordered an accounting. Later Jamco was found to be in contempt for violation of the injunction.  […]  [gadgetry as commonsense solution to a problem:]  Jamco asserts that these devices do not constitute invention, were anticipated by the prior art, and at the most show only mechanical improvements which should have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art.  […]  The crucial issue is whether 'the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.'  […]  The dividing line between what results from mechanical ability and what displays inventive genius is ill-defined. Perhaps no hard and fast definitive rule can or should be established.

[…] Recognizing that patentability is a question of law for the court,13  we cannot say that here there is a gadget as opposed to an invention. Certainly in a particular environment, the steering mechanism of motor vehicles, the peculiar and difficult problem of stabilizing that mechanism and protecting if from undue wear is solved in an expert, inexpensive and effective manner which attains an improved result. If the distinctive arrangement of the known elements would be apparent to a skilled mechanic, such fact is established neither by an examination of the devices nor by the evidence adduced at the trial. From the record presented to us the novel and distinctive combinations which make up the three patents in question require 'greater skill and higher thought than would be expected of an ordinary mechanic trained in the art.'14  In the circumstances, Jamco has not sustained the burden of overcoming the presumption of validity by clear and convincing evidence.","author":"","title":"","source":"United States Court of Appeals Tenth Circuit","notes":"http://bit.ly/9Z6Q7C.

Is there any known gadget for controlling a rampant Know-How?  The lady in the ad has found a mechanic substitute for moral choice?\"  \"As the ad implies, know-how is at once a technical and a moral sphere.  It is a duty for a woman to love her husband and also to love that soap that will make her husband love her.  It is a duty to be glamorous, cheerful, efficient, and, so far as possible, to run the home like an automatic factory.  This ad also draws attention to the tendency of the modern housewife, after a premarital spell in the business world, to embrace marriage and children but not housework.  Emotionally, she repudiates physical tasks with the same confection that she pursues hygiene.  And so the ad promises her a means of doing physical work without hating the husband who has dragged her into household drudgery.  /  To purchase gadgets that relieve this drudgery and thus promote domestic affection is, therefore, a duty, too.  And so it is that not only labor-saving appliances but food and nylons ('your legs owe it to their audience') are consumed and promoted with moral fervor.  /  But gadgets and gimmicks did not begin as physical objects, nor are they only to be understood as such today.  Benjamin Franklin, protean prototype and professor of know-how, is equally celebrated for both his material and psychological technology.  In his Autobiography, still a central feature of Yankee moral structure, he tells, for example, how he hit upon a system of moral bookkeeping which would enable any man to achieve perfection in several months.  The trick is to select only one fault at a time for deletion and by concentration and persistence the moral slate will soon be clean.  Related to this system was his discovery of various techniques for winning friends and influencing people which are still as serviceable as ever.","author":"McLuhan, Marshall","title":"Chapter \"Know-How.\"","source":"The Mechanical Bride: Folklore of Industrial Man.

Perhaps courts, so far as possible, should leave mechanical theories to mechanics and engineers and theories on science to scientists.

The force of gravity acting upon each log held it down upon the water and its buoyancy, responding to the law of displaced liquids, held it up.  When some force acted to overturn the raft, these two natural forces were brought into conflict, because either one log would have to rise against the law of gravity, or one would have to sink against the law of displaced liquids, before the raft could overturn.  To the extent that the two forces acted against each other, an entire new force, stability, wasp resent in the raft.  /  For good or evil, great as the invention of the atomic bomb may have been, the general invention produced no new force; it only released forces already present in nature.  /  The chieftain may only have produced a 'gadget' in the raft, but it still embodied a force which did not have even an incorporeal former existence.  /  Countless such forces are embodied in the mechanical devices that surround us.  Such forces are more fantastic than the fairies and genii who served favored mortals in the tales of the Arabian Nights.  Yet they are real.
