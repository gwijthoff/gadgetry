I carry in my pocket over half the elements on the periodic table, extracted from almost every continent on the planet and compressed into a thin slab that allows me to sample the feelings and moods of everyone Iâ€™ve ever met.

Living with technology in the twenty-first century is every bit as weird as the old science fictions imagined it would be. For most of us, the smartphone might as well be the *2001: A Space Odyssey* [monolith](/images/2001monolith.gif):  it's supposed to make us smarter the instant we touch it, but we have no idea how it works or where it came from. Despite our intimate familiarity with our gadgets---keeping them at our bedside, holding them during a moment of social awkwardness---we have an entirely fictional relationship to their technical complexities.

Gadgets are both physical tools and imaginary things: part functional, part fictional. This project explores the idea that, when it comes to conversations on the fraught relationship between technology and culture today, the fictions (rituals, beliefs, habits) deserve just as much scrutiny as the technical details (algorithms, rare earths, protocols). When we rely on historical and philosophical frameworks that have been tailored to experts, designers, and inventors, we end up overlooking "the 99%" of users:  the end users and laypeople who don't have to know *how* their devices work in order to rely on them every day.

In writing a cultural history of the gadget, I'm interested in the [curious rituals](http://curiousrituals.nearfuturelaboratory.com/) of everyday users; how folk knowledge adopts complex technoscientific objects; the uses of a tool that were never intended by its designers; and the ways that we can think about the micro-level habits and techniques of individual users adding up, in the aggregate, to macro-level paradigm shifts in media history.

This site contains research data and working notes for an upcoming book, *Gadgetry: A History of Techniques.*

Across the twentieth century, many kinds of objects were described as gadgets, from dashboard gauges to atomic bombs, can-openers to smartphones. While "gadget" can be a placeholder for any kind of object, even imaginary ones, its evolving application to particular tools and techniques reveals important lessons about our relationship to technology. The gadget is a unique genre, comprising physical objects, conceptions, and habits.

<!-- What counts as a gadget at different moments in time and why?

Different kinds of tools and techniques for using them count as `gadgetry` during different moments in time. The question is why, and what the history of those techniques offers our current impasse as users of emerging media today.-->

For this book, I search archives of novels, magazines, and newspapers in order to explore the distinctly vernacular philosophies---the media theories from below---that emerge from users of technology and their everyday practices. Using databases like the Corpus of Historical American English, Historical American Newspapers, and the Media History Digital Library, I proceed by collecting as many instances of the word "gadget" as possible and plugging them into categories of my own making based on how the term is applied: is the gadget handmade or mass produced, seen as important or a trinket? Does the word refer to the entirety of the tool or a component within it? And so on.

Inspired by Otto Neurath's 1920s design of the [ISOTYPE](http://www.designhistory.org/Symbols_pages/isotype.html) system, categories of gadgetry are indicated by icons <a href="/tags/gauge"> <i class="fa fa-tachometer-alt" style="color:red"></i></a> throughout this project.

Because I have hand-coded this "dataset" and designated myself the categories into which I sort each instance of the word (like control mechanisms <a href="/tags/lever"> <i class="fa fa-sliders-h" style="color:red"></i></a> and imaginary devices <a href="/tags/raygun"> <i class="fa fa-rocket" style="color:red"></i></a>), the portrait that emerges of a discourse on technology could be described as entirely of my own making, as opposed to algorithmically-generated. Part of this book is interested in exploring the difference between these two categories of interpretation when it comes to the history of collective mentalities.
