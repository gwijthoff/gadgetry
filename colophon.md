Research data and working notes for an upcoming book, *Gadgetry: A History of Techniques.* Site's bones are Jekyll (a static site generator), fleshed out in Tachyons (a CSS library), as mashed up in [jekyons](https://github.com/joshosbrn/jekyons).

I compile my research data in a Google spreadsheet, then export to JSON using an add-on called [ExportSheetData](https://github.com/Synthoid/ExportSheetData). This site then pulls from the JSON data each time it's generated using the [jekyll-get](https://github.com/18F/jekyll-get) plugin. Icons are by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
