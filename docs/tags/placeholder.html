But he still sometimes wonders what the functions of a doo-hickie might be.”

Also, that it has a Statistical Department and the usual number of factory departments with a foreman in charge of each.  The product is a small machine, which we will call a gadget, and it is composed of a few castings, which are purchased from an outside foundry, some commerical parts, and some parts which are made in the various departments.  The factory has been turning out about thirty machines a day, but, it is desired to increase this output to forty.”

[…]  Notes of jubilee drowned the plaintive cries of farmers and the queasy doubts of querulous critics.  According to the golden appearance of things, intensity would create novelty upon novelty, gadget upon gadget, to keep the nation’s machine whirling; inevitably outlets would be found for the accumulations of capital and the torrents of commodities; and employment would be afforded for laborers befitting their merits and diligence.  Articles for comfort and convenience, devices for diversion and amusement were multiplying with sensational rapidity, giving promise of a satisfaction even more gratifying.  Corporations were swelling in size, holding companies were rising to dizzy heights, the tide of liquid claims to wealth were flooding in.”

He had been bafled by it ever since Christmas morning, when it had arrived from the Dillards, along with some handkerchiefs of a sort of bleached burlap, and a tie.”  Don’t you know what it is?  “It’s a–a–puzzle.’  There was a long pause, and finally Mr. Edgell elaned forward in his chair.  ‘Yes, Alberta,’ he said, sweetly, ‘and it’s a damn good one.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “[The Food and Drugs Act] defines a drug as an agent used in the treatment of disease. Freckles, excess hair, wrinkles, enlarged pores, falling hair, obesity, and dandruff are not dis­ eases; they may be blemishes or botherations, but they no more classify as diseases than do irregularly architectures noses and shortness of stature. Hence cosmetics are not drugs, unless they make some specific claim to cute disease on their labels-which, generally speaking, they never do.  Cosmetics are surely not foods.  Gadgets to straighten noses are not drugs, and neither are mechanical chiropractors intended to stretch the short men to great height so that they may avoid the failures and humiliations those of small stature (like Napoleon) undergo.  /  Therefore the present Food and Drugs Act does not cover cosmetics. It does not cover therapeutic gadgets and contraptions, some of them selling for 10 dollars and costing 75 cents to make, and all of them as astonishingly magical in their claimed powers as the miraculous necklace some firm got out to cure goiter.  […]  In . consequence of these deficiencies which have made Dr. Harvey W. Wiley’s Food and Drugs Act obsolete, a revision of that act has been prepared to supersede the old statute. It was written by legal and scientific experts in the Department of Agriculture, gained the blessing of the Administration, and was introduced in the Senate by Senator Copeland in June 1933 as S. 1944.  That bill does specifically cover cosmetics. It covers gadgets and contrivances. It covers advertising, applying the same standard of accuracy to it that the present law applies to food and drug labels. It sets up food standards and it establishes minimum tolerances for the poison con­ tent of foods.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “In reading through “the glossy pages of a large and costly monthly” magazine…  “In absorbed fascination I read these slyly contrived proffering of wares, and I became aware as I read these slyly contrived profferings of wares, and I became aware, as I read, that almost all the advertised products–although as physically various as ice-boxes and pens, underwear and cigar-lighters–had a certain common aspect.  Almost all of them, in a word, were gadgets.  /  A gadget is not easy to define.  It is a kind of what’s or thingumabob or dingus–all these excellent slang words being themselves, alas, rather nebulous and indefinable.  The fact that it is indefinable may be, I suspect, the clue to the gadget’s nature.  The gadget, in short, is a gadget; which is to say that it is not definable in terms of its relation to the real life and basic pursuits of man.  A ‘hat’ we may define; it is an object to keep the human head warm or dry or shaded or otherwise comfortable.  We may readily enough define food or drink or books or houses.  But the gadget…” (590)  * * * “I hear complaints and repinings now and again that in this age philosophy is dead.  But I do not think so.  There has simply been substituted, for other philosophies, the philosophy of the gadget.  This philosophy is but materialism carried to a somewhat attenuated but entirely logical extreme.  It is the ultimate, and rather pathetic, expression of acquisitiveness.  […]  We have deified gadgets, precisely as we have tended more and more to make material concerns for ultimates of our thinking.  For that modern temper which delights ‘to pay devout and uncritical obeisance to the analytic intelligence,’ disclaiming every other human faculty of apprehension, and which–being beset by economic woes–is obsessed by economic criteria of values, and by those alone, it would be hard to find a more fitting symbol and insignia than The Gadget.”  “That we seek to appease this gnawing sense of want and incompleteness by devising newer and queerer and more elaborate gadgets is not more ridiculous than sad.  It is part of the flight from reality, or rather, perhaps, of the refusal to face reality steadfastly and with full realization.”  Goes to a “dream of some day about the year 5000” when archaeologists explore “the subterranean ruins of a great twentieth-century city,” uncovering miserable tabloids chronicling war, “night clubs,” and the horrors of… ::gasp:: stand up comedy!  “And then, in this dream, I see the leader of the archaeological party pounce with delight upon a small object in the dust, and I hear him cry ‘Here is their sacred talisman, the symbol of their religion!’ and I see him hold up to his conferères a cigar-lighter with the recipes for eight cocktails printed on it, and with a fountain-pen at one end of it and a flashlight at the other.”

It appears, at least from the advertisements of cutlery people, that whittling and woodcarving are coming back as serious hobbies.  This volume proves it.  Starting with a discussion of how to make the simplest toys and gadgets, trinkets, and wood chains, it proceeds to discuss the carving of human figures, elaborate chests, plaques, designs, and moldings for furniture.”

A test plant is nearly completed and together with the patent situation amply financed.  This is not another gadget but something of epoch-making importance.  There is nothing like it in existence and the art is susceptible of profitable development in a hundred directions for years to come.  The man is more important than the $5,000 which he must be prepared to lose, but the chances are better than 50% for him to make am illion, if the test plant operates, and extensive and expensive research and independent checking indicate it will.”

This self-denying ordinance covers most of the things with which, outside business hours, the ordinary person is mainly preoccupied–news, the day’s installment of the various radio epics, this year’s car models and gadgets, the latest fashions.  But it is upon fashions, cars and gadgets, upon news and the advertising for which news exists, that our present industrial and economic system depends for its proper functioning.  For, as ex-President Hoover pointed out not long ago, this system cannot work unless the demand for non-necessaries is not merely kept up, but continually expanded.”

Gillespie, who also reports that he has heard that Glen Hosberg is on the sick list.  …  Al (Pop) Adams, former partner with Stanley Naldrett in the operation of numerous gadget layouts, has returned to the pitch game after an absence of five years.  He’s currently operating his gadget stand on the Pacific Coast to reported big geedus counts.  …  Following a stay of many months, Stanley Naldrett closed his gadget bar in Silver’s store, Birmingham, September 30, and headed for Chicago where he plans to visit briefly and cut up a few jackies.  He will reopen his gadget layout in the Birmingham store January 3.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The effects of war on science itself were also both good and bad.  Unfortunately, the spectacular achievements of the war years led many people to believe that the sole function of science was to develop either weapons of war or the gadgets of peace.  Radar, rockets, and the atomic bomb, together with plastic automobiles, nuclear power plants, and television sets were regarded as the sole products of science, the reason for its existence, or the chief currency with which to measure its value.”  Example:  “A steel mill is built to make steel.  As the bars of steel come out of the mill the ear not labeled as to whether they shall be used for battleships or tanks or trucks or guns or plows.  Steel is a raw material.  It will be fabricated into whatever structures, gadgets, devices, or weapons are most in demand at the moment.”  “Too often we judge the value of knowledge by the new machines or gadgets or weapons it provides.  But a more far-reaching effect of knowledge is its effects on men’s minds.” “

First, as to its military applications: Operations research is applied at three levels, the use of weapons or gadgets, tactics and strategy. For simplicity consider only the first of these. The notion that we have learned the optimal use of present weapons, .or those in the development stage, Will not bear scrutiny.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The Gadget Maker is a 1955 novel by Maxwell Griffith. It is notable for its vivid depiction of an otherwise-rarely-described milieu: campus life at MIT in the 1940s. It also presents a striking engineers-eye-view of guided missile development at a West Coast aerospace firm during the early days of the cold war.  On its appearance, the New York Times described The Gadget Maker as “the story of a misguided zealot devoted body and soul to the advancement of knowledge” and called it “an absorbing narrative [and] a clear presentation of technological subject-matter, written with stylistic ease and fluidity by an author who is himself a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.”  Just a few phrases in the novel, such as “Essentially, engineering was the skilled bending and shaping of metals into airplanes, bridges, cars, gadgets galore.  Still, it required more than a skill at fabrication–an understanding, some vital spark of creativeness.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Your issue on automatic control is a vivid portrayal of a materialistic culture in which bright young men study engineering instead of philosophy. Only two authors (the first and last) weigh the tremendous problems that will follow the advances described by the other six. Each of these two speaks with the circumspection of one who elects to drift with the current rather than inquire too critically as to its direction.  Less inhibited philosophers–say Bertrand Russell, Karl Menninger, Julian Huxley, Henry Thoreau and Philip Wylie–have been genuinely worried that so much genius is directed at producing more and better gadgets rather than improving the aims, morals and happiness of man him­ self, a field commonly left to opportunists and superstition-mongers. Is it not cause for alarm that Nobelists in peace­ unlike those in physics or medicine­ have often been conspicuous only by their absence? Or that such a basic human urge as pride of achievement (the family piano) is steadily giving ground to pride of ownership (the family television)?”  “

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Model Jets and Rockets for Boys, by Raymond F. Yates. Harper &amp; Brothers ($2.50). Mr. Yates gives a brief history of rockets, and then devotes several chapters to detailed instructions on how to build jet propelled aircraft, racing cars and boats, using ordinary house­ hold items and a few gadgets that can be purchased inexpensively. A complete jet engine that will run a model plane at 200 miles per hour costs only $1.95; fuel tanks can be made out of empty 35-milli­ meter film containers.  […]  Coggins and Pratt offer for a somewhat older age group an interesting account of the history and development of these fateful gadgets. Their book describes the tightly packed, powder-filled paper tubes used in the 13th century by the Chinese to frighten off the Mongolian invaders, the Congreve rockets the British lobbed into Baltimore in 1814.”

The money and effort expanded to solve the problem were frightful too––and sometimes ludicrous.  No gadget, however complicated, was too ridiculous to consider––ocean-going passenger vessels fitted out like outrigger canoes may have looked funny, but they were worth a try.”

His  story sheds  light  on  emotional  development  in  a  mechanized  society.  […]  To counteract this fear we gave him a metal wastebasket in lieu of a toilet.  Eventually, when eliminating into the wastebasket, he no longer needed to take off all his clothes, nor to hold on to the wall.  He still needed the tubes and motors which, he believed, moved his bowels for him.  But here again the all-important machinery was itself a source of new terrors.  In Joey’s world the gadgets had to move their bowels, too.  He was terribly concerned that they should, but since they were so much more powerful than men, he was also terrified that if his tubes moved their bowels, their feces would fill all of space and leave no room to live.  He was thus always caught in some fearful contradiction.”

It was the artists who even set up the cry that one must not be satisfied to learn from the ancients or to take everything from books; one must examine nature for oneself.  The artists were often the engineers, the designers of fortifications, the inventors of gadgets; they were nearer to the artisan than were the scholars, and their studios often had the features of a laboratory or workshop.  […]  Science and craftsmanship, combined with the state of the market, enabled them, however, to indulge their zeal for gadgets, mechanical improvements and inventions.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “In adult life, in depressive and schizophrenic states, suicides and macabre mutilations are performed in the kitchen; and death by gas oven asphyxiation is a common type of suicide. Cases are reported where the individuals put their heads into the oven. The obsessive-compulsive neurotic fears sharp instruments and constantly worries about the gas heater being turned off or the toaster being disconnected. In the hysterical individual, the appliances often symbolize objects of both an oral and genital nature, wherever there can be substitute gratification and punishment. The hysterical patient may be fascinated with gadgetry and at the same time be worried about the safety of such automatic controls as timers, defrosters, and thermostats, as are built into the appliances. All modes of energy are transformed, neutralized, and regulated in the service of making life easier and supposedly more pleasureful. Very often the hope is that new devices will be both labor-saving and in the long run “ pay for themselves. “ Abetting the economic factor is the condensation of many processes and functions in the same unit.”

Flynn and Stone enjoyed the war. So did every other correspondent in Vietnam. We enjoyed the bitter humor and the proximity to all the gadgetry of war; even those of us who never shared the all-American fascination with weapons of death got a certain charge from being with those who did. We were heirs to the tradition of war, and war still meant finding the personal courage to edge right up to death while staying calm. It was no more or less complicated than a response to the ultimate challenge as outdated and senseless as a barroom showdown. And so we had this war, and my friends and I had to be there.”

She ran down the hill and out to the corn rows, leaping over the new green shoots and the plucked grain that the crows had despoiled, and she scattered the clods to a small dust that trembled in the air after her foot was gone. She walked through the house the next day on the duties assigned to her, as if she were no part of the place, as if she were an unrelated gadget pitched awkwardly through the utensils and through the prescribed hours. Her father spoke at the table: “ I spent the day in the corn. I replanted fifty hills the crows uprooted? a flock, a thousand strong, you’d think. “ “ I thought Joan made a scarecrow. “ They talked about the image in the upper field. “ No crow went anear the upper field, “ they said.

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Here again France is facing a situation which is common to all highly industrialized countries. The so-called bottlenecks of industrial production are looming large in Germany, England, even the United States, and professional economists everywhere are coming to insist that you may have large unemployment along with a serious shortage of skilled labor? indeed, paradoxically enough, the labor shortage may to a considerable extent be responsible for unemployment. The failure of one highly specialized factory manufacturing a particular gadget may hold up a great deal of industrial production which depends directly or indirectly upon that particular gadget. All that the November decrees did was to charge the Axe Committee with studying these bottlenecks and devising plans for a more effective distribution of labor.”

The heart and lungs were sound, but other internal organs yellow with rot. # The death of Mrs. Cardow, onetime dial painter for the Waterbury Clock Co., like the deaths and protracted illnesses of U.S. Radium Corp. scientists and minor employes (TIME, June 4, Nov. 26) is a social penalty for the public’s demand to have night-luminous watches, clocks, gadgets.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Outstanding fizzes in direct sales have been electric clocks, candy and mechanical preparations. Bust-up of the electric clock attempt was due to the facts, first, that most direct sales customers don’t have electricity, and second, it was a mechanical gadget which took plenty of involved vocabulary to explain. Direct sales men all state that the article must be simple and understandable immediately. “

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “It’s part of a $1.5 million contract awarded last April by NASAs Johnson Space Center, in Houston, for the preliminary design of the huge orbiting space station, scheduled for launch around 1993. The kitchen will have to store a 90-day supply of food for six or seven crew members. It will contain a full complement of amenities? now mostly lacking on the shuttle? including a refrigerator, oven, freezer, dishwasher, trash compactor, food and trash storage, and an inventory-control system. The appliances will be adapted from earthbound kitchen gadgets to operate satisfactorily in a microgravity environment. The idea is to make meals resemble those on Earth as much as possible.”

And then you gorge – secretly, in your chic, narrow esophagus of an alley kitchen with all those stainless steel gadgets. “ Such things you gorge on, dear Monica, so tacky. Fish and chips, ice cream by the half gallon – and not even ice cream from some SoHo specialty shop, but common supermarket lard. You make quite a pig of yourself, Monica, in that high-rent apartment of yours. And then you come to me. For absolution. “”
