  <strong>Quote:</strong> “an appliance to clean the bottom of the ship, without the necessity of dry-docking or employment of drivers.  It consists of an oblong structure armed with wire brushes, and looks very much like a door-mat.  This is pulled forwards and backwards by stout hawsers, made fast to the ship’s steam capstans.  It can be made to traverse any path the operator requires.  The bristles of the brushes are magnetised, so that they both attract themselves to the iron of the ship’s side and scrape as well.”  /  “It was wonderful to see how quickly the news spread round the ship that the electric scrubbing gadget was worried satisfactorily.”

I believe they did it on the pneumatic principle, not on the hydraulic, if you’re interested in those things.’  ‘I ain’t,’ Mr. Sugden retorted.  ‘I’m only concerned with outstanding social facts.  We leave machinery to the intellectuals.’  ‘That’s very kind of you.  The inventor of this particular gadget was the son of a woman who committed suicide somewhere in the Potteries, I’m told.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Look for another match!’  I cried to Davis, and although he knew he had no more, he began to throw things out of his pockets right and left.  Among these things there fell a smudge cigarette lighter.  These instruments were devised by the French on account of their extreme shortage of matches.  The gadget consists of a tiny steel wheel, which strikes a piece of flint, which in turn ignites the smudge.  The only trouble with these things is that they do not always work.”

The more modern apparatus upon which I personally worked was not perfected in time to have actual service overseas.  This remarkable ‘gadget,’ which is known as the multi-unit or M.V. Type of hydrophone, consists in general of two lines of twelve equally spaced microphones.  They are mounted – one on each side – below the water line and either beneath a protective ‘blister’ outside the skin of the vessel or sometimes within the forward water tank.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The painter of houses has always been puzzled for a way to plant his ladder against the side of the house without making a mark on the freshly laid paint.  A way to accomplish this is now offered him in the ingenious ladder-support illustrated.  On each upright of the ladder, near the tip, is clamped a curved brace, the other end of which is pointed.  These two points, one on either side of the ladder, furnish the bearing points for the ladder.  […] and they offer an extraordinarily convenient place from which to suspend the paint pot.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “A College Professor Solves a Mathematical Problem and Becomes a Wealthy Inventor.  Most of us are likely to think of an inventor as eagerly seeking some idea upon which to exercise his genius, and then bending over a work bench surrounded with wheels, wires and miscellaneous gadgets trying first this combination and then that until he works out his invention.  /  He gets his patent and makes the rounds of manu­facturers, all save one of whom laugh at his radical ideas, but that one sees something in it and makes a fortune.  /  The other day we were talking with an inventor who is not like that at all. He never thought of himself as an inventor, never looked for anything to invent, never had any intention of making a lot of money, believes he is weak in imagination-that quality so often considered necessary to success­ful invention-has put in far more time writing a book than he has done in inventing, has done his in­ venting only as a sort of side line and never bothered ped­dling an invention around among manufacturers. All the inventing he does is with a pen and a note book. And yet Louis Alan Hazeltine has made a fortune out of his inventions. The best known of them, of course, is the Neu­trodyne radio receiver.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “What do you think pleases my guests the most?’ Lewis asked.  After my tour of bewildering wonders I hesitated.  The engineer smiled and pointed to a shiny metal gadget on the wall.  ‘That little twenty-five-cent bottle opener and corkscrew, combined, makes more of a hit, if you’ll believe it, than some of our most ambitious engineering schemes.  They think it’s wonderful, and ask where they can buy one like it or whether they can have an extra one as a souvenir.  That’s human nature, I guess.  The average man, when he turns on a light or opens a radiator valve, doesn’t think of the power plant below that supplies him light and heat.  There’s far more to running a hotel than one ever sees in a guest room.’”

What’s that gadget? Backson inquired.  Latest thing to clean radiators, Gus replied.  Water goes in the big pipe and the little one is connected to the air pressure line.  Shooting the air in with the water in short bursts fills the radiator with a churning mixture of water and bubbles that loostens the sludge and rust lots better than the ordinary flushing out.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Similarly a romancer who had a cynical turn might foreshadow the collapse of Wester civilization, and call it The Triumph of the Gadget.  In all probability the emergence of the gadget has had a vast deal to do with the degenerative process.  During the last fifty years there has been invented almost every conceivable labor-saving device, with the consequence that the average man is in a state of utter manual incompetence.  This is well-known and is often commented upon.  But what is not so often observed in that these gadgets are not only labor-saving but brain-saving, thought-saving; and it seems an inescapable conclusion that a correlative mental incompetence is being induced.  /  A certain amount of resistance seems necessary for the proper functioning of mental and moral attributes, as it is for that of physical attributes.  In any of these three departments of life, if you can get results without effort, and habitually do so, the capacity for making the effort dwindles.  Whatever takes away the opportunity for effort, whatever obviates or reduces the need for making it, is therefore to some degree deleterious.  It needs a bit of brains to manage a furnace-fire successfully; an automatic heater needs none; hence many householders today could not manage a furnace-fire to save their lives”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Our monumental work on the Theory of Gadgets which has been, as they say, on the stocks for twenty years, is nearing completion.  But so, apparently, is civilization [gallows humor in the lead-up to war…].  And in case our publication date does not succeed in anticipating the final crash of Armageddon, we would like to give you a few hints of what these volumes would have contained.  /  Everybody knows what a gadget is, and yet a definition is hard to find.  After deep thought, we givey ou this:  A gadget is anything which, designed to simplify life, actually complicates it.  We are fully aware that this definition is almost revolutionary in its comprehensiveness.  Yet it is tenable.  It includes everything from a battleship to a fountain pen.  It includes the cigarette lighter that is always running dry, the electric icebox that springs a sulphur leak when eight guests are waiting for cocktails, the automatic shocke that saves two seconds in starting your car every day for thirty days, and on the thirty-first robs you of two hours of your time and two dollars of your money.  It includes most of the things you give your friends for Christmas, And [sic] all that you get.  /  In our chapter on Man and the Gadget, we show how man, the eternal sucker, progresses from enthusiasm to disillusion, repeatedly, all his life long–for the gadget has no experience value.  Elsewhere we estimate the time and money spent on the invention, manufacture, sale, operation, and final frenzied destruction of gadgets.  We list al known gadgets, showing the difference between promise and performance.  And finally, we paint a picture of a gadget-less Utopia, with a few practical hints on how to attain it.  /  The difficulty in completing this work has been in our gadget-testing department.  For obviously, if a single gadget is really found to simplify life, it nullifies our whole argument.  And new gadgets appear daily.  We were ready this morning to write finis–when we read of the new false teeth plates which have magnets set in them, with like poles opposing, to keep upper and lower plates apart and in place.  We have always insisted on doing all testing ourself.  Yet we still retain most of our original teeth, and are reluctant to sacrifice them, even to add the final proof to our theory.  For if the magnets don’t work, we have, it is true, the proof, but are just where we were before, and with nothing to chew with.  And if they do work, a lifetime of effort is undone.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “What an odd little word ‘gadget’ is, almost a gadget in itself, so small and useful.  Its origin is obscure and is believed not to appear in print before 1886.  Yet it is not, as might be though, an Americanism.  It appears as an expression used chiefly by seamen, meaning any small tool, contrivance, or piece of mechanism not dignified by any specific name; a what-not, in fact; a chicken-fixing, a gill-guy, a timmey-noggy, a wim-wom.  I commend these agreeable synonyms to Mr. Clarence Elliott’s notice, and at the same time record my gratitude for his revival of that other sea-0faring word, manavlins.  I wonder how many English-speaking people are familiar with its meaning?” (197).    “I mistrust gadgets, generally speaking.  They seldom work.  The proved, old-fashioned tool is usually better and it is safer to stick to it.  I thus make a rule of throwing all tempting catalogues of gardening gadgets straight into the waste-paper basket, not daring to examine them first, because I know that if I examine them I shall fall.  It will mean only that I shall with some trouble obtain a postal order for 10s. 6d., to acquire an object which will speedily join similar objects rusting in the tool shed.  It should be clear from this that my mistrust of gadgets is equalled only by my weakness for them, and that no amount of experience can make me find them anything but irresistible” (196).  Among her favorite gadgets:  “Then there is the long narrow trowel of stainless steel and it s associate the two-pronged hand fork, both unrivaled for weeding in between small plants, though perhaps there is no tool so well adapted for this purpose as the old table knife with the stump of a broken plaid.” (196)  But the “perfect gadget” is the “widger” – “the neatest, slimmest, and cheapest of all gadgets to carry in the pocket.  Officially the widget is Patent No. 828793, but it owes (I believe) its more personal name to the ingenuity of Mr. Clarence Elliott, whose racy gardening style ought to be more widely appreciated.  He invented the widger, its name, and the verb to wig, which, although not exactly onomatopoeic, suggests very successfully the action of prising up–you wig up a weed, or wig up a caked bit of soil for the purpose of aerating it–all very necessary operations which before the arrival of the widget were sometimes awkward to perform.  This small sleek object, four inches long, slides into the pocket, no more cumbersome than a pencil, and may be put to many uses.  Screwdriver, toothpick, letter-opener, widger, it fulfils [sic] all functions throughout the day.  Its creator, Mr. Elliot, I observe, spells it sometimes with a ‘y’: wydger, no doubt on the analogy of Blake’s Tyger, just to make it seem more unusual.  Whatever the spelling, it is the perfect gadget” (197).  Next chapter, “Tool-shed”:  “Different from gadgets are the time-honored tools which hang in the dusty brown twilight of the tool-shed when their day’s work is done.  The wood of their handles is as tawny as the arms of men who use them: the have a sun-burnt air.  The steel of spuds, forks, and trowels glistens quietly as though it were resting; it has been in contact with the earth all day, and recalls the old expedient of plunging a dirty knife-blade into the soil and withdrawing it restored to a brightness like the flash of Excalibur.  The prongs of forks are burnished as bayonets, the curve of hooks gleaming as sabers.  The big wooden trudges repose peacefully across the handles of the barrow.  The long handles of rakes and hoes dangle in rows, symmetrical as Uccello’s lances.  There is a shelf with all the odd accumulation of labels, green string, hedging-gloves, old tobacco tins full of saved seeds.  A hank of yellow bass hangs from a nail, blond as corn.  The flower-pots are piled, tier upon tier, red as a robin’s breast.  Red and brown, green and golden, steely as armor, dusty as snuff, the tool-shed deepens in shadow as the respite of evening shuts the door and leaves the small interior to the mouse” (199).”

Never has there been such a collection of picnic gadgets.  Never has there been such enticing picnic literature.  /  The photographs on these and following pages are an abbreviated catalog of modern picnic paraphenalia.  There are suitcases which are transformed into a table and benches, collapsible water buckets, asbestos gloves, aprons whihc become cushions, aprons with pot-holders, aprons for autographs, spits for shish kebabs, molds for hamburgers, grills for frankfurters, barbecue grills on wheels, cutlery kits, fitted cases with non-spillable salt cellars, constant bug sprayers, and dozens of other silly and practical devices.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Before you realize it the big Douglas C-39 transport is settling to earth. Here at the air depot are bigger and better hangars; better, in that they are equipped with most of the gadgets and machinery found in an aircraft factory, even to the expensive machine tools­ huge planers, millers, lathes, and grinders. Inside the hangar there are several craft in various stages of construction or destruction. The sergeant explains there are two classes of jobs done here at the de­ pot: FWT rebuilding jobs, and the reclamation of wrecks. FWT, he says, means “fair, wear and tear,” the wear due to normal service.”

What will come out each month no one knows until the wrapping is off.  All they know is that it will be some gadget representing the latest mechanical effort to make life a little easier, safer, or more fun.  /  What they get depends on whether they have sent in $1.00 for a six-month trial or $5.00 for a year’s subscription to a dozen bigger and better gadgets.  It may be a comb with a removable wick in its base, a powder fire extinguisher that doesn’t deteriorate, or a window-sash burglar alarm.  /   The gadgets are selected and distributed by the Gadget-of-the-Month Club, Los Angeles, Calif.  Anyone can submit an item for distribution.  There are only three requirements:  it must be new, must be patented or patent-applied-for, and must never have been distributed nationally.  A jury screens out the best bets, which are then sampled by 15,000 members of the Consumers’ Testing League.”  a different list for men and women, “since the men would hardly go for kitchen gimcracks, and the ladies could not be expected to rave about a razor guaranteed to shave under the nose.”  …  “Springing from the desire of 23 manufacturers to find customers for war-developed items, the club was organized in 1943.  Now the National Inventors Assn. and the national Gadgets Mfg. Assn. are joining with the club to stage a National Gadget Week in late April.  They plan to establish a community in California called ‘Gadgetville,’ where inventors can live and perfect their ideas.  In addition, ‘gadget nooks’ will be placed in retail stores across the nation, with a new item featured every week.  The nation will become more gadget-conscious than ever if these enterprising gadgeteers have their way.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “New crop includes everything from retrievers to mirrors to help the duffer approach par.  In the perennial pursuit of par, America’s three million golfers spend $40 million annually for equipment.  A surprisingly large proportion of this money goes for the scores of ingenious gadgets which are supposed to help every duffer hit his tee shot a little farther, get on the green a little sooner, and putt a little bit straighter.  While some of these gadgets help lower the golfer’s score, others soothe his sensitive nerves, like the ‘Retrevit’ which makes it simple to fish a poorly hit ball out of a stream.  In spite of the expenditures of cash and energy, however, less than .5% of all the golfers in the U.S. can shoot on par or under.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Pulling power of radio was dramatically demonstrated recently when a client, Gadget of the Month Club, was all but snowed under by tremendous response to plugs bought thru the spot sales department of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC).  Gadget of the Month, via blurbs on the web’s managed, owned and represented stations, was getting around 15,000 responses daily on its offer of gadgets for a small sum of money.  Lacking a national distribution setup, the firm fell far behind on deliveries–which resulted in stations getting plenty of squawks from listeners.  For a time some stations were afraid they’d have to take a loss and refund moola to listeners, but it’s claimed that the company is now caught up on deliveries.  According to Don Davis of the agency of Davis, Harrison, &amp; Simonds, Gadgets of the Month has now bought time on 350 outlets.  For a time, however, stations were plenty jittery.  Tex McCrary, for instance, on WNBC, NBC’s New York key, asked listeners to let him known if they had failed to receive their gadgets.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The wonderfully imaginative and often fantastic world of gadgetry was unfolded last week in the New York Trade Show Building, with more than 140 exhibitors taking part.  This was the second such effort promoted by a group of businessmen and managed by Hal Sommers, and the number of inventions aimed at simplifying everyday tasks came within a shade of doubling the total exhibited last year.  Gadgets have always held a fascination for the man on the street and his better half.  Among the items which have been surefire crowd stoppers in the past are the little gimmicks–the better mousetrap, so to speak–which show at a glance how to do something quicker and cleaner.  Some of those shown in New York, however, are a bit obscure as far as practical purpose is concerned, but they still are interesting enough to win attention.  …  The Gadget Show was initiated last year as a showplace for thousands of unknown innovations that flow from the American inventive mind.  To facilitate the marketing of practical gadgets the show management formed a Gadget Manufacturers’ Institute to counsel exhibitors in this year’s show.  It is staffed to conduct market research studies on bot consumer and trade levels, to define the potential markets for inventors and manufacturers.  The show was open to both consumers and trade.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Since considerable heat (ill-wind) can be created thru poor presentations, sloppy work and phony items, it was editable that a gadget workers’ protective organization make an appearance.  The new non-profit Exhibitors Association of America, headquartered in California, has been incorporated with the avowed aim of stopping unfair practices bothy by and against demonstrators.  It would improve the level of the demonstration industry and protect it from space rent and percentage gouging.  /  The person working gadgets is all things to all viewers, wherever the public congregates.  If they want humor he has it; the same goes for the many other qualities necessary to successful entertainment on a personnel level.  It is so personal, in fact, that unlike high paid public performers, the gadget worker’s immediate audience rarely numbers more than three dozen people and is no more than 12 feet from him.  If he is a top-notcher, however, he could get 75 per cent of his tip (audience) to vote him into Congress as easily as spring (spend) for a sale.  /  Basically speaking, the new and novel item is a traffic-stopper, enabling the demonstrator to build his tip.  He presents it in a [sic] appealing way through humor, stories, etc., hooding his tip’s attention while presenting the item.  Then comes his close (windup) and the request for sales.  Then comes a rehash of his spiel to convince additional viewers who have not sprung and also to hold the tip, which in itself is a good way to stop more traffic as passers-by gather to see what’s going on.  /  The business is a small one and far from the usual housewares salesmanship.  It has workers (commission agents) who act for the leaders, those pace-setters in the field.  There are independents, who do their own buying and renting of space, and who work alone except for an occasional partner or member of the family.  /  The field’s code of ethics is not one that a banker would follow.  It is generally a cash-on-the-line business, but it is not improper to owe money for merchandise when one is tapped out (broke), but eventual payment is a must if a worker expects to last in the industry.  Demonstrators playing a red one (successful fair date or celebration) are prone to help out another clansman by lending money or merchandise.  Credit information is entirely word of mouth, however, and reputations are soon established for honesty and reliability.  /  Altho most demonstrators work on limited capital a great deal of money can be made quickly and lost just as fast, in the trade.  Experience brings with it the ability to judge the quality and potential earnings of a location, and the knack of securing an occasional ex for gadgetry at certain fairs, on traveling shows, and at stores.  Sometimes a respected worker can control all gadget locations on a fairground by proving his competence to the fair secretary.  /  There is considerable disillusionment in the business,w which is constantly having its personnel weeded out as johnny-come-latelys fold up at the first sign of hardship.  Old-timers know, tho that rainy days soon pass, and when they do, the clan is busy at work building more tips and pocketing the profits.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “the world of kitchen gadgets is never in finer fettle than during the fair season, when gadget workers have already been pulling in cash at boardwalk stands, department stores and farmers markets.  This peculiar form of gadgetry is aimed right at the women, and in the hands of capable workers, it hardly ever misses its mark.  /  During good times and bad there has always been a call for gadgets.  They make their mark, last in popularity for a cycle of three years, more or less, then seemingly die as quickly as they were born.  But this is more a hibernation than death, since in kitchen gadgetry as in many other merchandising fields, old objects are frequently born over again and ride high on a new wave of popularity.  /  For example: 20 years ago a big item on boardwalks was the combination peeler-slicer, which both peeled and cored fruit such as apples, as well as scoring corn and being useful as a slicer.  That was 20 years ago, and it’s on the scene again.  /  For example:  Three years ago, choppers became a hot item, starting with a Swiss import retailing at $1.98.  American versions, like Rotomatic and Chopomatic, competed with the Swiss Blitzhacker.  Price was $2.98.  Mass production overtook the price and stamped it down to $1.98 and even lower in some cases, causing some perplexity by price-conscious demonstrators.  Rotomatic was replaced by the Imperial Food Chopper during this period.  But this price confusion was followed by a waning popularity and it was decided to produce a super model with a bigger bowl, capable of holding more and bigger vegetables and eliminating the need to slice some of them down to chopper size.  Now we have the Grown Imperial.  /  From 1952-‘54 the handy little Mouli Grater ($1 retail) nurtured a company which has taken on a wider line of kitchen gadgets.  There is a $2.98 Julienne and $4.98 Salad-Maker (retail).  /  Others among the wide assortment of plastic and metal gizmos directed at the American housewife–and so artfully demonstrated thruout the land–include a handy radish cutter which creates a radish flowered…”  /  * * * “Gadgets used to be set out on counters in cartons, but lately the poly bag has become a common display method.  One philosophy for this is that the American housewife wants to see what she’s buying.  Some French basket suppliers provide baskets in bulk, without any covering whatever.  The basket has come up so strongly that one manufacturer, fearful of rapid over-saturation, is offering a combination package.  This contains the French basket, a pastry maker, and pastryman’s cloth.  /  But there is virtually no end to the number of handy little gadgets offered as time-savers for the American kitchen.  The target is the womenfolk and, praise be, they have responded in admirable fashion for generations, always pushovers for kitchen aids.”  Later, kinds of objects:  “inexpensive tools, ‘unbreakable combs,’ radio station clearing coils, and other inexpensive pieces of merchandise.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The ‘gadget’, which is defined by Webster as slang meaning a ‘mechanical contrivance, a device, or any ingenious article’ has become a fundamental part of the American scene.”  “One cannot generalize from the study of these two cases. The psychological mechanisms described need not be characteristic of typical cultural attitudes, although there seems generally to be something derogatory in the use of the term, gadget” (339).  * * *“The machine deals with the external world directly and, although there are many exceptions, strives to create order from disorder. One can say that it is similar to a secondary process operation which takes the unorganized and gives it organization. In most cases a human being is required to operate machines. The gadget differs from the complex machine in that it minimizes the importance of the human being whereas the ordinary machine augments a person’s capacity to do work which requires secondary process operations. For example, typewriting is the use of a machine to record ideas which are refined and organized in the process of transmitting them to the machine. The typewriter is thus a mechanical aid to the secondary process operation. The gadget, on the other hand, requires a minimum of human intervention and gives the illusion of operating independently.  /  One cannot conceive of a machine performing secondary process operations independently, because in order to accomplish such a function there must also be a primary process. There are, however, a variety of electronic computers that seem almost to be able to think. Cybernetics, as we all know, has viewed the psychic apparatus in terms analogous to those of an electronic circuit and has caused machines to be built that function in a manner that is analogous to human logic.  /  Both patients stressed that the function of a gadget is secondary in importance to its operation, which obscured its purpose to them. Whether it worked or not, in terms of accomplishing what it is supposed to do, was a minor consideration. This does not mean that the gadget did not have to work perfectly in a mechanical sense, because if it did not the gadgeteer would be frustrated. What it did mean, to both the patients, was that the human appreciation of what the gadget accomplishes, for example, reproduction of music in such a way as to provide a gratifying and moving experience, tended to take second place in their minds to a pleasure in the operation of the gadget itself.” (336).  “Common among all the patients in this group was anger toward the gadget and the ‘gadgeteer’. To define these terms for the purpose of this paper is not easy. Any technological device, especially when first introduced, can be considered a gadget. These patients for the most part objected to two aspects of these devices which may be classified as follows. First, the regulation of time as in switches with either an automatic control or a feed-back mechanism to interrupt a circuit and turn something off or on. Included were such items as furnace controls, coffee makers, and radio switches that turn other mechanisms on and off. Second, enhancement of passivity. In this class can be included practically all objects that do work, and consequently permit more leisure. Automatic dishwashers, automatic transmissions in automobiles, and, especially, remote control of television without getting up from one’s armchair are a threat because of the enhancement of passivity.  Television itself was scorned by one patient who nevertheless succumbed to its lure and then watched it for hours every night. One patient was particularly chagrined to learn there was a switch that automatically controls a fan for ventilating a house, depending on the amount of heat in the attic. That it required a minimum of human intervention for its operation was what this patient found most disturbing.  /  This classification is sketchy and not technologically precise. As it is manifestly impossible to state definitely where invention ends and gadgeteering begins, it is striking that these patients frequently made such arbitrary distinctions. Patients pointed out that function was of little importance; the operation of the gadget was the primary feature. One patient spoke with anger of persons who were more interested in the tonal qualities of complex high fidelity sets than in the music. He referred to a recent joke of a person who contented himself with studying the wave patterns produced by an oscillograph hooked into the system.”  (330)  Catalogues patients who can only appreciate photographs and not painting for instance, appreciating technical perfection over beauty.  “In these instances, it is the person who is ingenious, not the machine; and such a person strives to be capable of accomplishing almost anything. The omnipotent qualities of such fantasies are extremely valuable in enhancing narcissism. Such a fantasy, especially when it is as compulsive as it was in both these patients, serves as a narcissistic, omnipotent, magical defense against the inner awareness of a weak and constricted ego” (339).  “To this artist, as it was to the scientist, the gadget served as an intensive means of communicating with reality.”  “In both these patients, the gadget was not only a factor that represented the operation of the secondary process, which is in opposition to instinctual forces, but, more specifically, it was a factor in preserving identity. In the first case, there was a direct correlation between the patient’s interest in gadgets and security in his identity. In the second case, there seemed to be an inverse correlation; greater preoccupation with the gadget threatened the patient’s ego ideal, and made him feel less secure of his identity.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “I fling that statement into the teeth of the sociologists who insist we have never had it so good.  We own machines, they say, to wash our dishes and to blend the hollandaise sauce.  We have gadgets to burn our toast, grind up our garbage and dry the laundry on rainy days.  …  Gadgets solve only mechanical problems.  They do not spice stew or mend the linen napkins.  They do not shop for groceries, plan menus, clean the car, entertain, administer, take temperatures or roll bandages for the Ladies of Charity.”  New section:  “The need for a radical gadget.”  “For while machines multiply, so do our responsibilities.  And no gadget can teach us how to best split–perhaps I should say, splinter–our personalities in order to live up to current standards.  Grandmother owned no vacuum cleaner but she also had fewer demands on her skills.  …  She was not expected, as we are, to combine in her one ladylike person the functions of wife, mother, interior decorator, registered nurse, child psychologist, landscape gardener, participator in public affairs, scintillating hostess, director of budgets and general good sport.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The pages present succinct descriptions, drawings and photographs of about three dozen marvelous gadgets from the heroic history of technology, all realized as working models.  There is no attempt to follow scale, materials or finish in authentic detail; the aim is to abstract and exhibit the ‘particular go’ of each machine.  Most of the devices are to be made at the woodworker’s bench, with some sheet-metal, plastic, rope or hardboard parts.  A number call for machined metal gearing that is beyond amateur skills; one can criticize the absence of much effort here to help young people take advantage of the rich marketplace of manufactured parts in our technological era.  The book is nonetheless a pleasure and a challenge.  Who would not like to see working models of the device used to generate screw threads without copying any existing thread; of the chinese spoon-tilt hammer, an automatic water-power scheme still familiar in Japanese gardens, or of the cornish man-engine, a vertical moving belt of miners, forerunner of the mine hoist?”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Is there a fuse blown and you haven’t noticed because you haven’t been anywhere else in the house? Are the control buttons correctly set and pushed in or turned all the way? Is the door or lid closed securely? A careful check first can save you time, money and a good deal of chagrin when a hastily summoned repairman does nothing more than reach down and nonchalantly push the electric plug back into the socket. A word about some of the lesser labor-savers, the kitchen gadgets, in particular. Think about them before you buy them. If they will not represent a real convenience, or you would not use them regularly, forget them. They take up valuable space, add to clutter, and do not pay their way in saving time. Sometimes they waste time. The mechanical hand chopper has not yet been invented that will do a more efficient job than a good sharp knife and a supple wrist attached to the arm of an accomplished cook.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Most of us who live in the latter decades of the 20th century take it for granted that advances in technology represent practical applications of earlier scientific discoveries.  In our vernacular the term “science and technology” is subconsciously hyphenated; once when I tried to refer in print to technology and science the typesetter “corrected” the sequence. In actuality the marriage of technology and science is not more than a century and a quarter old.  […]  Before that time science and technology lived apart. Science had been a largely speculative effort to understand nature, whereas technology was an ex­collusively practical attempt to use nature for human purposes. The two seldom in­terraced.  […]  How did technicians operate before they learned to get innovative ideas from science-indeed, before science had reached a state that could provide many such ideas?  […]  We underestimate today what keen empirical perception can pro­duce by way of technological novelty quite unrelated to scientific thinking.  […]  “

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “New York City’s Parks Department had a problem: tree thieves. One night somebody pinched 80 rhododendrons along upper Fifth Avenue; last year thieves dug up and hauled away more than $55,000 worth of newly planted shrubs and trees. Now the Parks people rig each new planting with a chain shackled to a stake. The stake is dropped into the hole and turned horizontally. Then the plant roots are arranged around the stake, the hole is filled and the entire gadget concealed with earth. The Parks Department claims it has foiled at least one would-be thief. Workmen in Central Park recently found a plant with all the dirt dug out around its roots, but still firmly anchored to its stake.”

He was a laughing, brawny man with meat on his breath, it was said that he loved machines excessively, that he was gadget crazy, deeply in debt. At the funeral, his two brothers come into the church trying to support his widow by each arm. A useless gesture, since she walks steadfast and crisply, supporting them if anything, with no outward show of grief. At the cemetery they stand very close together in front of the grave, huddled together like cattle seeking warmth, the raw November air pierces like needles, the sky is of the low, unvariegated gray that precurses snow.”

Now produced by automatic machinery, these cards are still expensive. Inasmuch as a separate card is needed for each thread of weft, a mere 10-inch design may require 800 cards which cost a little more than $100.00 to make. Not so with the Lefler robot. The cost has plummeted to $5.00. With this surprisingly simple gadget, the most intricate designs may be faithfully duplicated. Merely writing one’s name on a copper plate is sufficient to initiate an action that eventuates in the appearance of // that name woven into cloth with every shade and inflection perfectly preserved. A delicate electric finger plays over the inked copper master and delivers an electronically-amplified current to a series of small electromagnets each of which controls a needle of the loom.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “A couple of li’l gadgets have been picked up by Walter Futter on his trip here that should net him plenty. The first is a specially constructed microphone wit ha Voice Filter device. It will change any screen actor’s voice to any particular pleasant tone desired with the magic filter. It has been developed and patented by one of the country’s greatest organic chemists who has had lots to do with perfecting sound-on-film. . . . The second gadget picked up by the enterprising Mister Futter is a new type of make-up remover. . . . If Walter’s two gadgets work as per dope transmitted to us we figure Walt should be retiring on his millions a couple years from now.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “No wonder Lilian Bond is smiling! She has found a new can opener that accomplishes its task without the least bit of exertion on her part. [ . . . ] You slip a can of whatever you choose into a round, adjustable brace that holds it firm and stationary, push on a lever and the top of the can comes off slick as anything! This gadget is called “Dazey de Luxe,” formerly known as “Speedo. [. . . ] Any little girl likes cookies, and Shirley—the one and only Shirley—is no exception. That is the reason Mrs. Temple bought that truly remarkable gadget which has been put into use more than once in the Temple kitchen. It has various “form plates” which will cut cookie dough into various shapes. You select a plate, put the dough into the press, turn the crank and there are your cookies, all ready for the oven.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “And at last we have lighted on just the thing for in-between-hairdressing visits. It’s a clever little gadget called Lechler’s Ringlet Quick . . . and a neat remedy for ringlets that insist on dropping down on the neckline. You dampen the hair, hold the knob of the curler, release a spring, and slip in the hair to be curled. Wind tightly, slip a bobby pin into the ringlet, and draw out the curler. There you are . . . as many curls as you want on just one curler . . . and for only 50c.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Onslow Stevens thinks one of the handiest gadgets to have in the house is Holdems . . . for repairing loose chair rungs. “They really do the trick,” says Onslow. “You simply remove the rung in question and force it back into the socket with a Holdems alongside of it. The barbs on either side of the little metal gadget hold the run in place forever.””

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Are you a bachelor girl with a small apartment or room where you “keep house” and do your own lingerie washing? Then you’ll be tickled at this clever, new gadget that is a clothesline with rubber suction things at the end. Apply them on any smooth surface and they will stick, until you want to take them down. Clever, these modern gals! 15c buys the whole business!”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “H. Leslie Atlaas is head man of WBBM and the Chicago office of Columbia. His home is equipped with special lines so he can hear without a radio what his station and network are broadcasting by simply dialing a special telephone gadget. Also, the same system permits him to listen in on the monitor wire and hear what the engineers in the control rooms are saying to each other.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “From the pocket of his bulky parka (he had bought it convinced that from the Rockies east, America was a frigid wasteland after October 1st or so – now he was sweating rivers), Morgan Sloat took a small steel box. Below the latch were ten small buttons and an oblong of cloudy yellow glass a quarter of an inch high and two inches long. He pushed several of the buttons carefully with the fingernailof his left-hand pinky, and a series of numbers appeared briefly in the readout window. Sloat had bought this gadget, billed as the world’s smallest safe, in Zurich. According to the man who had sold it to him, not even a week in a crematory oven would breach its carbon-steel integrity. Now it clicked open. Sloat folded back two tiny wings of ebony jeweler’s velvet, revealing something he had had for well over twenty years – since long before the odious little brat who was causing all this trouble had been born. It was a tarnished tin key”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Most 3-D TV systems rely on simple binocular vision to create depth: When your eyes and brain see objects from slightly different perspectives, a sense of depth, called stereopsis, results. The first gadget to exploit stereopsis, the mirror stereoscope, was invented in 1833 by Sir Charles Wheatstone. He created pairs of drawings, each slightly different from the other to simulate left- and right-eye views, to form a 3-D image when viewed through mirrors.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Jesse set off happily every morning for his computer job, and returned every evening with some newp248baby-care gadget – a pack of bunny-shaped diaper pins or an ingenious spouted training cup. He was reading up on childbirth and kept embracing different theories, each more peculiar than the last. (For instance, at one point he proposed that the delivery take place underwater, but he couldn’t find a doctor who would agree to it.)”

Morris Markey, “The Prophets”:  New Yorker interview with a meteorologist.  “We began with the barometer, because that was just beside his desk.  Rather, let us say, five of them were beside his desk.  They were no fancy optical-shop gadgets with enamelled dials and brass needles.  They were simple tubes of mercury, two or three feet high, with scales affixed to them after the manner of a thermometer.” (74)”
