  <strong>Quote:</strong> “an appliance to clean the bottom of the ship, without the necessity of dry-docking or employment of drivers.  It consists of an oblong structure armed with wire brushes, and looks very much like a door-mat.  This is pulled forwards and backwards by stout hawsers, made fast to the ship’s steam capstans.  It can be made to traverse any path the operator requires.  The bristles of the brushes are magnetised, so that they both attract themselves to the iron of the ship’s side and scrape as well.”  /  “It was wonderful to see how quickly the news spread round the ship that the electric scrubbing gadget was worried satisfactorily.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Look for another match!’  I cried to Davis, and although he knew he had no more, he began to throw things out of his pockets right and left.  Among these things there fell a smudge cigarette lighter.  These instruments were devised by the French on account of their extreme shortage of matches.  The gadget consists of a tiny steel wheel, which strikes a piece of flint, which in turn ignites the smudge.  The only trouble with these things is that they do not always work.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “It is inexcusable folly to have something go wrong 50 miles from nowhere, and then wish vainly that you had purchased some badly needed gadget before you started.  A collapsible bucket, for example, is almost indispensable if the engine overheats and the water boils away.  An extra gallon or so of oil and five gallons of gasoline are other factors of safety.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Handy Gadgets for the Amateur Gardener.  All those who have gardens know the fatigue pursuant to kneeling when any operation is required near the surface of the ground.  From England we have a kneeling mat which seems to solve the problem very effectually.  It is made of rush or straw and the bottom is water-proofed so that the damp and dew will not strike through.  These pads are very extensively used in England.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Now we’ll give it a real good cleaning out, he said as he carried the radiator over to the washstand and attached a special fixture to the lower hose connection.  What’s that gadget? Backson inquired.  Latest thing to clean radiators, Gus replied.  Water goes in the big pipe and the little one is connected to the air pressure line.  Shooting the air in with the water in short bursts fills the radiator with a churning mixture of water and bubbles that loostens the sludge and rust lots better than the ordinary flushing out.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “If the summer now drawing to a close had any distinction fun-wise, it was in all the new and wonderful things people carried to the beach with them as a protection against the sun.  Nowhere was this display of luxury gadgets more concentrated than at the private beach clubs along the Atlantic seaboard.  At such places, at least, medical warnings against sunburn had had their effect on sunbathers who employed all manner of doodads to avoid blistering.”  an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch screen made of canvas and cellophane.  Sunshade that lays over eyes.  “Lewis &amp; Conger’s ‘sun-meter,’ a clocklike device which rings a bell after a set time to warn you to turn over like a squab on a spit.”  …  caption:  “With no gadgets at all this girl has a grand time just holding her hat on.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Before you realize it the big Douglas C-39 transport is settling to earth. Here at the air depot are bigger and better hangars; better, in that they are equipped with most of the gadgets and machinery found in an aircraft factory, even to the expensive machine tools­ huge planers, millers, lathes, and grinders. Inside the hangar there are several craft in various stages of construction or destruction. The sergeant explains there are two classes of jobs done here at the de­ pot: FWT rebuilding jobs, and the reclamation of wrecks. FWT, he says, means “fair, wear and tear,” the wear due to normal service.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The Saturday morning session opened with an announcement by George Moore on the winners of the gadget contest.  A total of five gadgets was submitted but it is believed that if traveling conditions had been better a larger number would have been submitted because there is always considerable interest shown in this contest.  …  The winning gadgets submittd and their order in the contest are as follows:  /  The lime slacking machine sumbitted by Harold R. Fanning … who is Superintendent of Sanitation and Bendix Aviation Corporation, received first place.  /  The sludge sampler submitted by… received second place.  /  The diagram of the sludge sampler submitted … was third choice of the membership.  /  Following the announcement regarding the gadget contest winners, Morrish Cohn of Schenectady pointed out the need of this nation for more money to conduct this war and appealed to everybody to buy an extra War Bond in the Fifth War Bond Drive.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Now, with honorable discharge, some 20 basic plastics are back in civvies–but not the same youthful prewar civvies.  Plastics’ postwar garb is man-size stuff worthy of materials that can swing their weight around in the industrial big leagues.  …  In view of these facts, can you blame the industry for being a little irate over any interpretation of plastics as something out of which lipstick holders and all sorts of gadgets are made?  …  ‘Let’s not talk about new plastic gadgets,’ pleaded a spokesman for the Dow Chemical Company recently.  ‘Every manufacturer is being pushed at the present time to produce enough plastics for practical purposes.””

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Pascual now is claiming for himself a new attitude.  ‘I’m really ready,’ he says.  ‘My arm feels better because of that machine.’  /  The ‘machine,’ according to Herb Heft, chief publicist of the Senators, isn’t quite ‘new.’  ‘It’s a gadget that our trainer, George Lentz, used on only two pitchers–Sid Hudson and Rae Scarborough,’ he explains.  ‘He’d put it away because nobody else had much confidence in it, but now Pascual thinks it’s the greatest invention since atomic energy.’  /  It’s merely a dusted-off gadget that vibrates with a rubber tip, Heft says, but it makes Pascual feel that the only-tired arm of a starting pitcher isn’t his own private hell the next day.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The  pace  is  lively  and  the  tone sure. Ancient bureaucracy gets no char­ity  from  Hodges;  weighing  very  lightly a good deal of evidence, he is committed to the superior inventiveness of unstable periods  in  history.  Materials  engage  his interest  most  easily;  it  is  clear  that  he prefers  chemistry  to  physics.  One  mar­velous  gadget  is  a  bronze sickle with  a wooden  handle  cunningly  fitted  to  the user’s thumb and fingers that  “would un­doubtedly  win  an  award  at  any  design center.”  It was  made  by an  alpine peas­ant craftsman  3,000 years ago.”
