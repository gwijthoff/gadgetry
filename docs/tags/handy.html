  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Only about a decade ago, we had an infant industry, manufacturing radio sets, which was facing a problem unprecedented in business history.  For in order to sell its product and thrive, it had to produce something else which that product could pluck out of the air.  This was the beginning of broadcasting.  /  A gadget which boys of all ages had put together in the attic, came down into the living-room.  Promptly technical discoveries began revolutionizing the gadget itself; and a growing and vociferous demand for good programs created a second bewildering problem.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Yet in all our wide reading about the unfortunate incident, we recall not one hint of certain broader implications. Too much was said of war psychosis and nothing of the normal human equation. We had thought that the Brooklyn Bridge would find no “buyers” now, yet the confidence men who periodically “sold” that structure in the old days had a harder job than the broadcasters of H. G Wells’ drama, for the latter explained over and over what they were doing. It begins to look as though there must be something inherent in the radio, in the mystery of a voice coming from an unseen speaker through a gadget of wires and tubes, that inspires unquestioning confidence. Otherwise, despite the war psychosis explanation, why did not more people question this particular broadcast as did one man we know who did not hear the original announcement?”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “A pang of regret touched many hearts when the news of the death of Dr Thorndyke, the famous forensic medico, was published a few weeks ago.  (I mean of course the death of Austin Freeman; in first-rate detective fiction, the creator is annihilated by his creation.)  It was not easy to become intimate with Thorndyke.  He was a robot of induction–always strong against romantic investigation.  He distrusted intuition.  His technical knowledge was so wide and so minute that on occasion he became a bit of a bore with it.  Yet he never showed off about it.  He used to quietly say: ‘We may as well.’  and then do things, incomprehensible to the layman, with dusting powders, refined chemicals and portable gadgets, which were carried by his assistant, Polton, in what must have been a compressible box–one of those cases you can squash when they begin to bulge.  Had Thorndyke no close friend?  He had one.  What was the friend’s name?  I know, because I have just looked it up.  It was Jarvis.  I had forgotten it.  Jarvis was nobody.  Austin Freeman disdained character-creation.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Late in the 18th century Charles Stanhope, third Earl, a British statesman and inventor, built the first true logic machine, the Stanhope Demonstrator.  The Demonstrator was a crude gadget for solving syllogisms.  A syllogism consists of a major premise and a minor premise, the first making a statement about a “predicate term” and a “middle term,” the second about the same middle term and a “subject term.” By eliminating the middle term one arrives at the correct conclusion as to the relation of subject to predicate. In Stanhope’s Demonstrator the middle term was represented by a small wooden panel called the “holon.” It had a frame through which other panels could be slid to cover all or part of the holon. A panel of gray wood, representing the subject, was pushed in from the left, and one of red glass, representing the predicate, was pushed in over this from the right.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The waveguide is only one of many gadgets that microwaves have brought to radio. There are the cavity resonator (which is used to produce high electric fields, to filter signals, to provide circuits in vacuum tubes, and so on), the magnetron and the klystron (used to produce bursts of high power, notably as pulses for radar), and a host of others. But the story of most of them has frequently been told, and this is not the place for a detailed catalogue of microwave equipment.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The early extracurricular interests of these men were varied, but here, too, there are some general patterns. More of the physicists than of the other groups showed early interests directly related to their later occupations, but this seems quite clearly to be due to the common small-boy preoccupation in this country with physical gadgets–radio, Meccano sets and so on. The theoretical physicists were omnivorous readers, the experimentalists much less so.  […]  From fiddling with gadgets to becoming a physicist may be no great leap, but the attractions of theoretical physics are not so obvious or well known, nor are those of the social sciences or advanced biology.”

The Atomic Energy Commission has just issued a new policy directive on the use of the lie detector at Oak Ridge.  It will no longer be used for periodic mass examinations of the several thousand employees assigned there to ‘sensitive’ jobs.  Future lie detector examinations anywhere in the AEC will be confined to specific cases and will be undertaken on a ‘voluntary’ basis and only when authorized by the general manager.”  “

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Claude E. Shannon, Hagelbarger’s colleague at Bell Labs, built a second penny matcher along the same lines, but using a different criterion for deciding when the opponent’s play pattern justifies a departure from random choices.  In an article in the Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers, Shannon describes how the designers tried to figure out mathematically which machine could beat the other.  They finally had to give up and leave the experiment.  They built a third machine to act as umpire and go-between, plugged all three together and let them run, ‘to the accompaniment of small side bets and loud cheering.’  Although he does not specify the owner of the winning gadget, Shannon reports that the ‘more precipitate of the who consistently beat the larger, more deliberate one in a ratio of about 55 to 45.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The men have been crowded nearly off the ship by electronic gadgets.  Radar sets and automatic control devices take up so much room that the crew must sling its hammocks in odd corners and queue up for an hour to get a meal.  Water is rationed because machines have replaced some of the storage tanks.  So the sailors begin to extract a vacuum tube here, drop a quiet monkey wrench there.  The press, as over-hasty in taking reassurance as it had been in taking alarm, was naively relieved to learn that the trouble was not foreign sabotage but just a revolt of the crew.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Among other discoveries, it was found possible  to  make  the  brain  stimulate  itself  by  positive  feedback.  The  electric impulses from the brain were  connected through  the  recording  machine  to  the electronic  gadget  that  produced  the flashes  of  light.  In  this  way  a  brain  re­sponse  to  a  flash  triggered  a  new  flash and  so  on.  This  method  of  self-excite­ment  is  particularly  effective  for  reveal­ing  a  hidden  tendency  to  epileptic seizures.  It  resembles  very  closely  the way an engineer may test the stability of a  transmission  system:  he  applies  posi­tive  feedback  to disturb  the  system  and observes how effectively the system’s in­herent  negative  feedback  operates  to damp  the  disturbance  and  restore  equi­librium.”

I knew damned well I wasn’t dreaming.  Then a voice, a boozy voice which I recognized instantly, and which sounded maudlin and terrifying, shouted in my ear: ‘Where’s that damned gadget?’  /  ‘What gadget?’  I gurgled, struggling to release the grip around my throat.  /  ‘The radio!  Where are you hiding it?”

Whenever  a  practical  method  is developed  for  generating  high-power radio  waves  in  the  region  between  one­ half  millimeter  and  five  millimeters-a source  which  is  tunable  and  produces highly  monochromatic  waves-it  will  be of great value to science and  to  industry.”

The picture area is 80 square inches–same as an ordinary 14-inch screen.  It runs on batteries (which can be recharged at home) or on house current.  The price is not outrageous for such a seductive adult toy: $255” (65).  “Americans like to move around.  And they insist on taking their entertainment with them–the magazine rolled into a pocket, the portable radio held at ear level” (65-6).  “But the manufacturer’s motive for gambling a million or so on such a new product can be considerably more complex.  He may hope that (a) people will buy the gadget because it is a Practical and Useful Convenicence; pr (b) people may not need the gadget but will buy anyway because it is The Thing to Do, like dancing the cha-cha-cha; or © people will come into the store to see the Amazing New Invention and end up buying something else he wants to sell, as they look at convertibles and buy sedans” (65).

The telephone, telegraph, movie, radio and television were regarded as mere ‘gadgets’ in their early stages. In fact, nearly all basic inventions must necessarily go through the ‘gadget’ stage.  The Patent Office policy of resolving doubts in favor of the inventor is thus sound.  It encourages investment which promotes industrial progress.”

Some owners of cooperative apartments are compelled to spend large sums to insulate their dwellings more satisfactorily against the noise of their neighbors. […] In Europe long experience in apartment living and a popular taste for gracious living (in preference to gadgets) have led to careful attention to noise control in the construction of multiple-family dwellings.  Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden and the U.S.S.R. have well-developed acoustical building codes that have been applied to the large-scale program of rebuilding of housing since World War II.”

Towns couldn’t get over how sharp and clear the picture was. He was not very mechanical, but he loved tiny, intricately made gadgets and had a vision of filling up a warm, comfortable apartment with them, living in it and spending most of his time turning them on and off. He felt a sudden burst of love for the tiny Japanese man who was practically a transistor himself and wanted to bend over and give him a hug.  The fellow was very tiny and Towns wondered what would happen if he caught a disease that made you lose weight. He would probably just get a little smaller and stay all right.”

There was a package of warranties in the box, but Towns had no heart to get started with them. Besides, he had the feeling that once a mechanical gadget was injured, it went downhill no matter what you did to it. He gave the porter a look and then tossed the set lightly into a trash container. Someone in the terminal said the astronauts were going to be down in forty-five minutes. There wasn’t any time to fool around now.”

Free of charge, Washington’s C &amp;; P Telephone Co. has installed ten of its still experimental “ picturephones “ in the offices of the highest presidential advisers. The gadgets, small TV sets attached to the telephone, allow the presidential elite to dial-in one another’s images as well as voices-not that any one of them is likely to forget what the others look like.  Apart from broadcasting status, the picturephones contribute little to the smoother workings of Government. To Egghead Kissinger, they are a technological mystery.

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Shortly fate noon––after a nearby siren yelped for a few seconds to remind one, if he had forgotten, of the perilous state of the world––Willie kicked on Lesser’s door with the heel of his shoe, holding in both arms, in fact weighed down by it, his massive typewriter.  Lesser, for a surprised second, couldn’t imagine why he had come, was startled by the sight of him.  Willie wore a blue-and-purple sack-like woolen African tunic over his overalls. His hair wasn’t Afro-styled, as Lesser had thought, but combed straight as though against the grain, with a part on the left side, and raised in back like a floor plank that had sprung up. The stringy goatee flowering under his chin lengthened his face and seemed to emphasize the protrusive quality of his eyes, more white than brown. Standing, he was about five ten, taller than Lesser had imagined. “ Could I park this gadget here till the morning? I would hate to have it stolen out of my office. I been hiding it in the closet but that ain’t hiding, if you dig. “ Lesser, after hesitation, dug. “ Are you through for the day? “ “ What’s it to you? “ “ Nothing, I only thought? “ “ I go on from eight to twelve or thereabouts, “ said the black, “ full four hours’ work and then goof off?”

But I’ve decided, for now, not to get involved in the financial and legal transactions I’d have to have with the phone company before I’d he allowed to connect the computer to the phone and have it place calls or answer the phone when was away and dialled it to get a status report on the house. ‘’ Mr. Prugh is quick to admit that a number of relatively inexpensive gadgets – a clock, a calculator, a player piano, a text-editing typewriter,a burglar-alarm system, and so on – can, separately, perform many of the tasks his computer has learned, and also that his computer is “ not what we at the Defense Department call cost-effective. “  However, he admires the computer’s versatility (“ No clock can cope with my income taxes “), and he believes that a home computer will be economically feasible in the not very distant future.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Fun and serious business with the small electronic calculator.  […]  If  you could  climb  into  a  time  machine and  go  back  to  ancient  Athens  for  a visit  with  Aristotle,  what  could  you carry in your pocket that would most aston­ish  him?  I  suggest  it  would  be  a  pocket calculator.  Its  Arabic  number  system,  its light-emitting  diodes,  its  miniaturized  cir­cuitry isomorphic with Boolean logic  (Aris­totle, remember, invented formal logic) and above all  its  computational  speed  and  power  would  intrigue  him more  than  any  other small  object  I  can  think  of.  /  The  revolutionary consequences  of  these miraculous little gadgets are only beginning to  be manifest. Among engineers and  scientists  the  slide  rule  has  already  become  al­most  as  obsolete  as  the  abacus. It  is  sad  to think  of  the  mathematicians  of  recent  cen­turies  who  devoted  years  to  the  arduous calculation of logarithms and trigonometric functions. Today  an  engineer  finds  it  takes less  time to  calculate  such numbers all over again  on  a  pocket  machine  than  to  look them  up  in  a  book  or  make  a  slide-rule approximation.”

He immediately canceled his other plans and agreed to collect her in three hours at the airport. Almost automatically, he asked where she was. “ There is no message, “ she whispered. Levanter took a taxi to the airport. He was half an hour early and dismissed the cab. He wandered through the lounges, watched the departing passengers lined up to pass through the gates of the electronic surveillance gadgetry, had a cup of coffee, and finally went to stand at the entrance of the terminal, where he was to meet her.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “As 2009 winds down and we try to come up with new and clever ways of referring to the early years of this century, there’s really only one thing left to do: declare our ten favorite gadgets of the aughts and show them off in chronological order. It’s arguable that if this wasn’t the decade of gadgets, it was certainly a decade shaped by gadgets – one which saw the birth of a new kind of connectedness. In just ten years time, gadgets have touched almost every aspect of our daily lives, and personal technology has come into its own in a way never before seen. It’s a decade that’s been marked the ubiquity of the internet, the downfall of the desktop, and the series finale of Friends, but we’ve boiled it down to the ten devices we’ve loved the most and worked the hardest over the past ten years. We even had some of our friends in the tech community chime in with their picks on what they thought was the gadget or tech of the decade – so join us for a look back at the best (gadget) years ever!”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “It seems like ages since Amazon introduced us to the $199 Fire at a hectic New York City event, but in truth that was only about six weeks ago. Maybe our perception of time is warped because we’ve been hearing talk about this 7-inch Android tablet for months now. Maybe it’s because Amazon launching a tablet seemed like such a natural thing to do after Barnes &amp; Noble paved the way with its Nook Color. Or, maybe it’s just because the gadget Amazon shipped looks nigh-identical to the 7-inch BlackBerry PlayBook that we’ve had for, well, ages.”

The Kindle Touch is the first to really bridge that gap in a way that makes sense.” A particular kind of electronic device – cellphone or tablet, as opposed to e-reader.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The tapes that prompted Richard Nixon’s Watergate resignation in 1974 might never have existed had he not been such a klutz with gadgets. Nixon was reluctant to have his conversations recorded, writes former Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman in Prologue, a National Archives publication. But if there had to be a taping system, the President said, he wanted something simple – like Lyndon Johnson’s manually operated setup. # Haldeman was worried that his chief would forget to turn the gizmo on when he wanted it, or – worse – to turn it off when he didn’t. Haldeman also fretted “ that this President was far too inept”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The list of “ indirect “ spinoffs from Project Apollo features one of the most revolutionary gadgets of modern times: the home computer. Back in the late 1950s, the state-of-the-art computer was the size of a city block. The space program encouraged an extraordinary process of miniaturization that down-sized master computers. As it happened, the Eagle’s 17-pound model was not equal to its task. But its development helped spark the personal-computer revolution.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “In fact, the West German firm of Siemens AG, using a different technology, has built a prototype 14-in. screen just 2.3 in. thick. The prototype will have a more immediate application as a computer accessory than as a home TV screen. But one slender advantage is already possible: the Siemens screen can be folded up for storage or transport. # “ Meanwhile, Sony expects the Watchman to alter, or at least extend, any number of viewing habits. People can gaze at the gadget on the beach, carry it into stadium stands to catch instant replays, use it for soap-opera breaks while at school or work, or take it along on car trips. Predicts Warren Zorek, the manager of the consumer electronics department at Bloomingdale’s in Manhattan: A color version should be on the way before too long, and it isn’t farfetched to foresee hand-held video-game attachments and personal computer compatibility.’”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “A feat of heart surgery sharpens the debate over benefits and costs # The dying heart was an I ugly yellowish color when Dr. William DeVries finally cut it loose, tore it out of the Mercurochrome-stained chest cavity, and put it to one side. For the next three hours, while a nearby heart-lung bypass machine kept the unconscious patient alive-and while a tape in the background eerily played Mendelssohn and Vivaldi-DeVries’ sure hands carefully stitched into place a grapefruit-size gadget made of aluminum and polyurethane. At 12:50 p.m. last Monday, the Jarvik-7 artificial heart newly sewn inside William J. Schroeder began beating steadily, 70 beats to the minute. When Schroeder opened his eyes 3 hours later in the intensive-care unit, DeVries bent over his patient and whispered assurances, “ The operation is all through. You did really well. Everything is perfect. “ So, for only the second time in history, a human heart had been permanently replaced by a machine.”
