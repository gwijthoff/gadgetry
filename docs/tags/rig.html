But when it comes to modern initiative–God knows, you must jack up those men yourself.  I’m close, but you’re their skin.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Further, at Cape Evans there had been running for more than three months a scientific station, which rivaled in thoroughness and exactitude any other such station in the world.  I hope that later a more detailed account may be given of this continuous series of observations, some of them demanding the most complex mechanism, and all of the watched over by enthusiastic experts.  It must here suffice to say that we who on our return saw for the first time the hut and its annexes completely equipped were amazed; though perhaps the gadget which appealed most to us at first was the electric apparatus by which the cook, whose invention it was, controlled the rising of his excellent bread.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “A Handy Gadget for the Magazine Subscriber.  How do you remove the wrappers from tightly rolled newspapers or magazines?  […]  The problem has been solved by a cutter devised by Arthur F. Hoffman, a rural mail carrier at Harvard, Neb., recently submitted to the Post Office Department and approved by the Postal authorities.  The cutter is in the form of a knife with a curved and flattened tip.  The flat point is easily inserted underneath the wrapper and a forward movement of the instrument results in clean cutting of the covering without damage to the contents.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “But that was just the beginning.  Gadget upon gadget blossomed forth and went into immediate use.  A kitchen rack arose, with hooks for pots and pans and space for plates and eating utensils.  A ‘cup tree’ spread out its arms.  Over in that corner (I am pointing SW now) we dug an underground refrigerator.  And in the other direction was the covered garbage hole and the grease trap, which consisted of a small pit with a wicker cover.  On the cover we piled a couple of handfulls of dry grass to absorb the grease from the messy water poured through it.  The grass we renewed daily, burning the old lot.  […]  All this was the work of the first couple of days in camp, but the gadget idea went on.  We moved forward under the battle cry, ‘Let’s have another gadget!’ and the further result was a camp broom, fire tongs, rustic broilers, a hot-plate holder, pot hooks, a serving table, shoe racks, a bulletin board, and even a primitive mail box before the ten days were up. […]  How many of that type of gadget shall we be seeing in your camp this summer?”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “This book is the work of many authors.  No one person could ever think up half the things it contains.  It came out of the sweat and toil and practical experience of hundreds of enthusiastic photographers whose nimble wits have devised thse clever mechanical means for overcoming some of their many difficulties that stand between them and the attainment of their goal.  …  Photography is a many-sided hobby.  Among other diversions, it provides those of its devotees who like to tinker with tools a never ending incentive to make devices for which they have immediate and very practical use.  They ahve the fun of making things whose utility amply justifies the time and inexpensive materials required.  …  It is not the purpose of most of these ingenious gadgets to take trade away from the photographic manufacturer.  Commercial products cannot usually be duplicated in the home workshop at anything like the cost of the manufactured article.  But here are many items not regularly marketed.  They would probably not have sufficient sale to warrant their manufacture, although many of them will prove invaluable to workers faced with problems similar to those of the writers.  We are confident that no one seriously engaged in photography, especially under makeshift conditions in the home where so much enthusiastic work is done, can fail to find in this book many hints which will save him not only an appreciable amount of time and money, but also much vexation of spirit.”

The glass flask was resorted to in order to protect all essential parts from the birds, who seemed to feel that I had made a gadget for their special benefit. The neck of the flask and a part of the sphere were removed with a ‘biscuit cutter’ (simply a cylinder of sheet metal) and abrasive. The plate of the clock, having nearly twice the radius of the sphere, was spun to its required curvature. All the machining was done on a wood-working lathe and drill press in the pattern shop here at The California Institute of Technology. Figure 5 is a photograph of an­ other spherical globe sun-clock made earlier and partly similar.  […]  The clock to be described is about my tenth design and its performance has been so satisfactory that I have decided to call it quits and turn the information over to those who may wish to have a gadget in their gardens demonstrating an interesting problem in celestial mechanics.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “It’s a lot of fun, as any amateur telescope maker will tell you, to invent, design, and then build gadgets to save labor, even if the actual labor saving is minus quantity.  You get your pay when you can step aside and watch them function automatically, with a self-satisfied grin on your face.  Who cares about time, anyway.  /  Top-flight position as Public Gadgeteer No. 1 undoubtedly has now been won by Kenneth Richter, 33 Clarence Ave., Bridgewater, Mass, whose star camera works while he sleeps.  It is in storage just now, as Richter is away at Harvard and in summer is running a “Chromocinemataudiographic Expedition, Ltd.’ (possibly ‘limited’ refers to the funds) somewhere between hudson Bay and the N. Pole.  Nevertheless we invited him to remove the bushel from off its light, so the rest of us could see its glimmer.  /  “The desire for the instrument was born of the fact that we have but two seasons in Bridgewater-the cold sea­ son and the mosquito season, and both are too uncomfortable for visual guiding of an astronomical camera. There­fore, about a year’s work was spent overcoming the discomfort of attend­ ing the camera throughout the night­ the exposure is made automatically.  /  At about dark, I go out, lift the cover off the instrument, and pull out the plate holder slide against a stop. Next, I go in and set a clock by my bedside for the time I want the exposure to start, also for the length of time it is to run. Then I work on a mirror, take the girl friend to a movie (though building the thing kept me so broke that this is just wishful thinking) or I go to bed.  /  At, say, 2 A.M., the clock turns on the power.  Outside, the camera springs to life. A small motor swings the flap shutter open, and an electro­ magnet holds it thereafter when the small motor has shut itself off by breaking its own circuit just as the shutter strikes the magnet. The latter is energized by a radio ‘A’ eliminator, to avoid the vibration of the camera that would result from the use of an A.C. magnet. This is a satis­ factory source of 6-v., D.C., well filtered. Meanwhile a synchronous motor drive, using one of the hen’s-teeth 4-watt Warren motors, has started to apply the diurnal motion.  […]  While almost all the gadgets are simple enough to be foolproof in operation, the drive frequently messes up the work.  Other than that, one might say that it saves me probably 2 hours’ work a week.  The number of hours required to build the machine would, of course, swallow up this saving for several years.  However, I don’t even try to justify it as a net, over-all time saver.  It isn’t.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> ““These are the preliminary adjustments. When these are complete, I should start collimating from both ends, and meet in the middle. Insert the main mirror and line up so that the optical axis coincides with the cross-wires. Insert accurate cross-wires at the inner end of the declina­tion axis (c, Figure 1). A cap should be provided for the eyepiece adapter tube, with a small hole in the exact center. Such a cap can easily be made of tin, and is a very useful gadget.”  […]  Again, all this is largely of general interest, alone, to the average amateur, because the necessary furnace is seldom available.  Gemmill states that homemade blower could be rigged up with an oil burner and some sort of retort.  Again we have the intangible factor of fun pottering with gadgets, and when some too practical-minded critic comes along to remark, ‘Does it pay?’ you say ‘No,’–and go on pottering, leaving him shaking his head.  He will never understand the mainsprings of the experimental urge.””

The final gadget idea of the group was (8) a rubber ball impinged over the valve of the radiator so that spouting steam would not ruin the wallpaper…”  (21)”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> ““At the center of gravity of my gadget I put a nut in the baseboard to fit a standard camera tripod screw. Thus, by using a pan head on the tripod I have an equatorial mounting which facilitates pointing the gadget at the sun as the sun moves. This really helps.  /  “To line up the gadget, move the tar­ get until the diameter of the solar image is single and a minimum. It is well to cover either hole in the mask separately, examining the image with a low-power magnifier to note whether it is circular and whether it has a flare on one side caused by lack of squareness in the posi­tion of the target or the lens.  Clamp the binocular hinge to its support, point the gadget at the sun, and observe the images.””

They were developed by workers who wanted to attain better efficiency or greater safety on their jobs.  Perhaps you have a gadget that would be interesting to your own company.  If so, your management may be willing to consider its possible inclusion in this show so others may share its benefits.”  “Mechanical ingenuity is typical of the American worker.  From the cotton gin to the can opener he has used his inventiveness to create devices that do things more efficiently, more easily, more safely or at lower cost.  /  In an effort to further simulate such ingenuity, and also to assist in the exchange of ideas of this type, we are presenting this collection of ‘gadgets.’  /  For the most part, they are not commercially available but have been made up by the machine shops of the plants involved.  A few however have been in such demand that independent manufacturers were requested to produce and market them.  /  The Du Pont Chambers Works Safety Section and the Du Pont Wilmington Safety and Fire Protection Division were instrumental in making this collection possible.”  “

Steeplechase, being quite an old operation, got started on its safety campaign many years ago.  …  Many operators have come up with gadgets to prevent ride mishaps and I will outline some of ours, first telling a Class A example of one which paid for itself nicely.  …  The gadget used here is the same in principal that we use on other rides.  That is, a three-inch pipe protrudes next to each wheel, so that if an axle breaks or a wheel is thrown, the car body merely settles a couple of inches onto the pipe, instead of falling thru to the ground.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “However, the third Alexander Calder demonstrated from his childhood an adventuresomeness and ingenuity that clearly marked him as no mere follower, even of his talented forebears.  Growing up in Arizona, California and New York, young ‘‘Sandy’ Calder tirelessly crafted playthings and other gadgets out of wire, wood and nails. In 1919 he graduated as an engineer from the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, N.J., then set out on an eccentric progression of technical jobs. As a boilerman on a passenger liner, he devised a contraption to direct sea breezes into the stifling engine room.”

He calls it a “ violaeol, “ a word made up from violin and aeolian. Miss Violet Sheldon was interested. # Also to be seen: a clock with a million possible settings for the alarm; an automatic chewing gum vendor in which a miniature bronco kicks out the gum; an iron mask to supplant hot towels in facial massages; a gadget for looping up trouser-legs to resemble knickerbockers; a powder-puff for removing neck wrinkles and double chins; a mechanical backscratcher. # Albert G. Burns of Oakland, Calif, was re-elected president of the Congress. It was Mr. Burns who last year revealed that a Clevelander named Antonio Longoria had invented a death-ray which killed rabbits, dogs &amp;; cats instantly (TIME, July 23). President Burns said that Inventor Longoria would withhold his secret until invasion threatened the U. S.”

It consisted of a selenium cell on one side of the chimney, and an electric bulb on the other. And when the next rain fell the young Cal Tech man did not have to go out and get wet, for the smoke would cut off the light and thus operate the galvanometer hooked to the cell, ringing a bell when the smoke would appear. The apparatus was so good that it is still in use in the chimney after all these years. / The young college student was Frank Capra . . . “

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “An ingenious contraption called a “Thrill- O-Meter” was used for advance publicity on “Rue Morgue” by C. E. O’Donnell, manager of the Paramount Theatre, Baton Rouge, La. This thrill-o-meter was constructed by- building a lobby cut-out and using the figure of a gorilla. The display was arranged so that its base covered the lobby scales. Then under the scales platform, a water bag was placed, filled with colored liquid. The hot water bag was attached to a glass indicator tube which ran up the center of the cut-out. At various levels on the indicator, small cards were placed with copy such as : 200-220. .. .You like to be thrilled! 160-180. .. .We advise you to be accom- panied by an escort! 120-140 Its thrills will chill you! Wear an overcoat ! 80-100. . . .You have an average heart and can stand the supreme thrills in “Murders in the Rue Morgue !” 40- 60…. Don’t enter unless accompanied by a friend ! - 20. . . .You’re too young to see this pic- ture without your parents ! We believe the above description will en- able the average person to construct a simi- lar gadget, if the spirit so prompts him, and we are indebted to O’Donnell for passing along the information.”
