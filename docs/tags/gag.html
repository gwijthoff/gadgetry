  <strong>Year:</strong> 1937

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Gag, ‘a joke or imposture; a hoax.’  Gadget, ‘a contrivance, object or device; a term often used to denote something novel’–slang.  Gimmick, ‘any small device used secretly by a magician in performing a trick.’”  “The author, while performing professionally, from 1908 until 1921, when he entered the radio broadcasting field at WLW, Cincinnati, believed he had originated many new ideas in magic, only to find that someone else had the same ideas.  A memorandum book, with the idea and date of its creation, with a signature of a witness, is necessary to prove originality in lawful court, and therefore, it is a suggestion, that should you develop a new idea in magic, follow this procedure.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Gadget sticks out tongue at noisy driver.  New device gives ‘razz’ to silly auto horn tutors.  […]  Millions of motorists have wanted a gadget of this type for years, and Fooey Face has now been placed on the market.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Jesse also invented a mowing machine which he sold to McCormick, a whistling buoy, and practical joke gadgets. Taking a fancy to Simon, Uncle Jesse brought him into his foundry and taught him to use tools. That shop was Simon Lake’s university.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Each subject was told that his task was to transport all the weights in the wagon from one side of a table (‘Lawrence’) to the other side (‘Topeka’), that the wheels must roll freely, that he could make as many trips as he wished and that there were no hidden tricks or gadgets on the wagon––that its rolling was a function of the among of weight in it.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “I felt an anxiety building up in my chest. I became so agitated that I dropped my writing pad, and my pencil rolled out of sight. Don Juan and don Genaro immediately began a most farcical search for it. I had never seen a more astonishing performance of theatrical magic and sleight of hand. Except that there was no stage, or props, or any type of gadgetry, and the performers did not seem to be using sleight of hand. Don Genaro, the head magician, and his assistant, don Juan, produced in a matter of minutes the most astounding, bizarre, and outlandish collection of objects which they found underneath, or behind, or above every object within the periphery of the Jumada. In the style of stage magic, don Genaro would proceed to find an object, which he would throw away as soon as he had attested that it was not […]”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Of what use are they except as criminal weapons? With attempts at gun control, how about knife control? As a start, how about a Sullivan Law banning all knife sales to juveniles and banning the sale of novelty knives in souvenir and gadget stores in the Times Square area and elsewhere? Stabbing homicides may take a sharp drop if these steps are taken.”
