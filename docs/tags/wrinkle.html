  <strong>Quote:</strong> “If technique is, as Mark Twain suggested, doing something simple in a complicated way, then a wrinkle suggests the reverse of this; that is, a simple method of doing something complicated.  If a botanist requires several complex solutions to stain certain fibbers, that is technique.  Another botanist’s suggestion that he would get the same result with a drop of marking ink is a wrinkle.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “But if a gadget is a machine, an invention, a mechanical means of achieving a result, a wrinkle is a method of procedure.  Again our lexicographer, rating the word as colloquial, one step higher than slang, describes it as ‘a curious or ingenious notion; happy thought.’  I will accept that phrase ‘happy thought’ as particularly pat.  But to the seaman, a gadget is a thing, and a wrinkle is a method, and both of them for most part unusual and unstandardized.” (viii))  /  That a gadget is a solution that arises naturally out of the materials of the ship – similar to distinction made in US Court of Appeals case on the difference between a gadget and an invention:  “In the long centuries in which men have sailed the seas, they have faced and solved oft-recurring problems.  When these problems present themselves on every passage and on every tack, the means of solving them are built right into the ship or her rigging.  ut when, as so often occurs, the problem arises out of some unusual situation, the sailor is forced to turn inventor.  He calls upon all his ingenuity.  He summons to his aid his past experience with the solution of some similar problem.  And perhaps he remembers, with that strange race memory which is often mis-called instinct, some similar experience of a sea-going ancestor.”  /  “Our lexicographers define a gadget as ‘anything the name of which cannot be recalled at the moment,’ and in parentheses, they add (Slang, U.S. Navy.)  But the name has a broader meaning and a riper antiquity than the dictionary credits.  I believe the term is older than the navy itself, ad far too deeply imbedded in the language to merit the transitory stigma of slang.  A landsman’s synonyms for gadget are thing-um-bob, widget, what-do-yer-call-it, do-funny.  A sailor’s synonym is gilhickey, although a purist would make a distinction by never using the term gilhickey except to distinguish one gadget from another.  The first gadget is the gadget.  The second gadget in any situation in which two appear is the gilhickey.”  (viii)  /  The temporality/longevity/life-span of a gadget–“But it must not be considered that the term is applied merely as a temporary substitute for an object’s true name.  Most of the unusual things about a ship go nameless forever.  When an invention becomes so standardized that it acquires a name, it ceases to be a gadget except for those brief periods when its distinguishing name is forgotten.  But there are thousands of unusual things about a ship or a yacht that were born gadgets and will remain gadgets as long as they are used.  They are the inventions that solve the rare problems, the machines that are unnecessary on most vessels and at most times and are therefore nameless.” That at any moment, a gadget could become a wrinkle and vice versa–the difference between a tool and a procedure is not readily identifiable:  “I have been sore put to it to organize this book.  For I am dealing with concepts that have thus far resisted organization so well that they have avoided being tagged with names.  Also it is pretty hard to tell where a gadget begins and a wrinkle ends or vice versa.  Take a familiar example.  You are about to tie two lines together.  You tie them into a weaver’s knot.  Standard practice so far–no gadgets, no wrinkles.  The nrealizing that ther eis going to be a terrific strain on that line and that the knot will be pulled so tight that you will never be able to untie it again, you decide to slip a toggle into the knot.  That’s a happy thought, for you can always take a hammer and drive out the toggle and the knot will be loose.  What is that toggle–a winkle or a gadget?  Now suppose we decide that the strain is going to be so great that it will be difficult to drive out an ordinary toggle.  So we use a large fid whose sloping shape assures us that the slightest driving with the hammer will loosen the knot.  Is the wrinkle now a gadget?  Or if the small end of the fid is greased to make it slip more easily through the the tight turns of the knot, does it become a wrinkle again?  I don’t know and I don’t pretend to try to find out.  The line of demarkation is too indistinct.  So I shall write about gadgets and wrinkles without worrying much about branding them with their proper names.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “In every real woodman’s kit you’ll find them–gadgets or doodads or wrinkles, or whatever you want to call them.  They won’t be big, nor will there be many of them.  But through experience, some camper has proved they will make life in the out-of-doors more enjoyable.”  “A firebug is simple to make and about the handiest thing imaginable.  With the help of one of these efficient little pyromaniacs you can’t miss with a fire, even in a downpour.  The firebug will give you six minutes of hot flame.  Just wrap two feet of thick string around seven matches and dip into warm paraffin.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Appellee-plaintiffs sued for the infringement of three patents relating to steering gear idler arm assemblies of automobiles. Appellants-defendants,2  asserted that the patents were invalid because of lack of invention and that there was no infringement. The trial court upheld validity, found and enjoined infringement, and ordered an accounting. Later Jamco was found to be in contempt for violation of the injunction.  […]  [gadgetry as commonsense solution to a problem:]  Jamco asserts that these devices do not constitute invention, were anticipated by the prior art, and at the most show only mechanical improvements which should have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art.  […]  The crucial issue is whether ‘the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.’  […]  The dividing line between what results from mechanical ability and what displays inventive genius is ill-defined. Perhaps no hard and fast definitive rule can or should be established. We have here combination patents utilizing such well and commonly known elements as bearings, grease seals, washers, bushings, nuts and bolts. In Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340 U.S. 147, 151, and 152, 71 S.Ct. 127, 129, 95 L.Ed. 162, it was said that ‘the concept of invention is inherently elusive when applied to combination of old elements’ and that ‘courts should scrutinize combination patent claims with a care proportioned to the difficulty and improbability of finding invention in an assembly of old elements.’  […] Recognizing that patentability is a question of law for the court,13  we cannot say that here there is a gadget as opposed to an invention. Certainly in a particular environment, the steering mechanism of motor vehicles, the peculiar and difficult problem of stabilizing that mechanism and protecting if from undue wear is solved in an expert, inexpensive and effective manner which attains an improved result. If the distinctive arrangement of the known elements would be apparent to a skilled mechanic, such fact is established neither by an examination of the devices nor by the evidence adduced at the trial. From the record presented to us the novel and distinctive combinations which make up the three patents in question require ‘greater skill and higher thought than would be expected of an ordinary mechanic trained in the art.’14  In the circumstances, Jamco has not sustained the burden of overcoming the presumption of validity by clear and convincing evidence.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Turning out clean and accurate work is the aim of every craftsman.  In addition to hand skills, the average fellow rigs up all kinds of gimmicks and gadgets to help him with his work.  Sometimes it’s how you do a job that makes the difference between the craftsman and the sloppy workman.  Here are seven different gimmicks, gadgets, and ‘how-to’s’ that will give you suggestions for doing a few jobs easier and better.”  “Use a block of wood when you want to line up two pieces accurately for gluing or nailing.  Block holds surfaces [sic] absolutely flush and even.”  “Sanding small pieces is easiest if you move the work to the sandpaper.  Fasten a sheet of fine garnet paper to a piece of wood with tacks.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “one of Jefferson’s most ingenious devices, for the rungs are all hinged, the uprights are grooved, and the whole thing folds up into the appearance of a single, solid, slender piece of mahogany (see page 484). Above the same portico is a weather vane, but its mechanism extends down to the out-of-door ceiling, where he installed a dial and indicator, so that he could inform himself of the direction of the wind without leaving the protection of his own roof (see Color Plate XVIII). THE OWNER OF MONTICELLO LOVED A GADGET Jefferson designed and built several curious tables. One of these had a revolving top, so that sitting by it he could, without |p488 rising, bring to his hand objects on the opposite side of it? a sort of first cousin to “ Lazy Susan. “ Another of his tables had hollow legs, in which were rods supporting the writing surface; but these rods were so hinged to the top that he could not only raise and secure the top at a height which made it convenient for him to write or read or draw at it when standing up or sitting down, but he could also tilt the top at any angle he found convenient. Obviously he belonged to that large brotherhood which loves a gadget. Quick to appreciate ingenious novelties, he picked them up wherever he found them, and not only brought them home, but he improved them. One such contrivance was an attachment which he found in Milan, for the hub of his carriage wheel to tell the nummer of revolutions made obviously the granddaddy of the modern speedometer. Another was a polygraph, a writing machine, which made two copies with only one writing (see Color Plate XXIV). Jefferson improved on this, so that his polygraph”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Tired of lacing up his boots, a Chicagoan named W. L, Judson in 1893 devised the world’s first slide fastener. It worked badly, but it made an instantaneous impression upon Colonel Lewis Walker, a lawyer from Meadville, Pa. Colonel Walker spent the next 20 years and about $1,000,000 collected from a multitude of sources, before he began to achieve any commercial success with the gadget. Judson was unable to perfect it and it was not until 1913 that one Gideon Sundback developed the “ zipper “ as everyone now knows it. Started that year in a $300-a-year shack in Meadville, Hookless Fastener Co., maker of “ Talon “ fasteners, immediately went to town, is now the biggest of 16-odd U. S. zipper makers.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “We often wonder when Jackson Rose sleeps. Jack is one of Hollywood’s best known cameramen. But he is equally well known for his creation of new gadgets and devices to aid in the cinematographic field. Some time ago he brought out a focus chart that created much interest. Now he has improved upon that chart and has produced a gadget that should prove a very valuable adjunct to any cameraman’s equipment. It is a combination focus chart and scene slate. On one side is the chart, on the other the slate. The entire gadget is of a heavy quality fabrakoid. The entire chart and slate folds up and when ready for packing or putting in the pocket is 12 inches x 4 3/4 inches in size. On the outside of the gadget is a place for the camera report for the laboratory. The device should be very valuable on location trips.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “It must require a lot of ingenuity for actors to think up the things that they think up to buy and do when they are between pictures—or even when they are between scenes in a picture. . . . They can’t even relax for a few moments between shots when they are working the set. They have to think up practical jokes to play on some one or a new game for next week’s party. Or they send to the corner drug store for a gag or a gadget. How they all love gadgets! / Maybe I had better try to explain, in my slightly bewildered fashion, what a gadget is / If I understand it rightly, it is something which seems to be useful but isn’t. It must be expensive. It must be something the like of which you never saw before—so that when the proud owner displays it you will look astonished and say, ‘Oooops! How cute!’ Or maybe you just say, ‘Well! Well!’ Any exclamation of that sort will make the owner happy. . . . Guy Kibbee attaches a little motion-picture camera in front of his hat when he goes fishing alone. Robert Taylor’s cuff links are weensy-weensy watches too small to tell the time except with a magnifying glass. Hugh Herbert has a time clock arrangement that dims the light when it’s time for him to stop reading in bed. Chester Morris’s electric toothbrush is the smartest gadget in town these days.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “BACK IN THE good old days, folks wore high button shoes, spats, buttoned gloves, and stiff shirt fronts with a row of little buttons that were hard to manipulate. So little gadgets called “ button hoolts, “ “ buttoners, or sometimes even “ hookers “ were used to do the job. Hutton hooks certainly were born out of necessity, and they were produced in various sizes, styles, shapes, and materials. Because they’re small, easy to display, and usually found for reasonable prices, button hooks are one of the nicest things to get hooked on.”
