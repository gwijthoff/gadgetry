  <strong>Quote:</strong> “…for on taking the wheel I found a machine under my hands such as I never even heard of before.  The wheel was fixed upon the tiller in such a manner that the whole concern travelled backwards and forwards across the deck in the maddest kind of way.  […]  I fairly shook with apprehension lest the mate should come and look in the compass.  I had been accustomed to hard words if I did not steer within half a point each way;  but here was a ‘gadget’ that worked me to death, the result a wake like the letter S.  Gradually I got the hang of the thing, becoming easier in my mind on my own account.  Even that was not an unmixed blessing, for I had now some leisure to listen to the goings-on around the deck.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “He makes change a dozen times, answers questions with a smile, hollers ‘Step up in the aisle;’ pulls a lever here and there regulating brakes and air.  When he is prepared to go, shuts the bird-cage with his toe, moves a gadget with his knee–regulates the speed, you see–pulls the bell cord with his teeth, lest some folks get caught beneath.  That would throw ‘er off the track; maybe flop ‘er on ‘er back.  Calls out names of every street, punches transfers with his feet.  Thus he earns his daily pay, running cars out Summit Way.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Somehow or other I can’t get on to this radio a little bit.  When you get that sending outfit rigged you’ll have to go down and test it.  I’d probably bungle something.  I didn’t even dare meddle with this gadget for tuning.  I tried it once and when your voice stopped I just shoved her back and let it go at that.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “PERPLEX is the ideal Tank for the Home Laboratory. It is versatile, accommodating 5 different film sizes. Made entirely of Bake­lite, it is non-corrosive and thus impervious to the effects of photographic chemicals.  It is simple to operate, has no complicating gadgets and obviates the necessity of difficult finger manipulation. Superbly constructed and yield­ ing fine results, it is moderately priced at $8.50.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “In figure 5 the Herschel wedge is shown at the left.  Near it is a three-lens Ramsden eyepiece made by Taylor and at the right is another of his gadgets, a micrometer focus control.  This may be used on any telescope having a standard 1 1/4” diameter eyepiece fitting and it moves the eyepiece assembly in or out of focus, similar to a rack and pinion.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “We admit that, like other camera users, we desire occasionally–and, when we can afford it, fulfill the desire–to trade in our camera for a new one, one equipped with the newer gadgets.  They are hard to resist, those handsomely contrived, new camera models, not only because they are good to look at but the new gadgets are real improvements and signify advances in camera design.  Nevertheless, no matter how long or short the period during which a camera is actually in our position it was a new one when we bought it and that, for us at least, is important.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “After all,’ says the concluding sentence in the foreword to an instruction booklet for one of the Filmo cameras, ‘we made the camera, so first try our way of using it.’  There’s a lot of common sense back of that, obvious though it may appear to be.  Over-confidence and eagerness to get going with the new outfit frequently induces people of newly purchased cameras to use the camera before they have read the instructions.  The consequence too often is that something jams because some little gadget was not properly adjusted, although reference to a single line in the instructions would have avoided the accident.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “He must sit cramped and alone in the narrow confines of his gad­get-filled quarters for hours at a time. He is often cold, having only the shelter of thin plastic or glass walls to protect him from the frigid temperatures of high altitudes. His often-tense body be­ comes numb from the bomber’s vibration; particularly so if his post is in a tail turret, but he must fight off torpidity as he would enemy planes.”

Instructions on the repair of model trains, the making of stations, switches, signals, scenery, bridges, viaducts, remote-control gadgets; how, in other words, to pursue the small-train hobby while pretending to be doing it for your children. Mr. Yates has also taken pains to lay out simple jobs the children can do so as not to disturb you.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Wiener is a fluent writer, but this is not much of a novel.  It has some merit as social criticism, it describes ingeniously the technical stuff (control gadgetry) and the patent and corporate chicaneries one can get away with in our society, but the hero is a cold fish, a sort of Armenian trader whom one never gets either to like or to understand.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “If mitosis is not desperately discouraging as a problem of molecular biology, it is because the complex operations are embodied in a definite structural assembly––the mitotic apparatus––that can be regarded as a gadget for performing the operations.  We can approach the physics and chemistry of mitosis through the study of the formation, structure and changes of the mitotic apparatus, without forgetting that mitosis is an operation of the whole cell.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “[…]others stood around carrying the beers, the whiskey, the whatnot like altarbearers but with considerably more guilt and with a stirring in their gut that you feel in a whorehouse when you’re told to wait for the girl and suddenly you hear high-heel steps coming down the hall and envision the legs, the garters, the thighs, the panties, the breasts, the throat, the face, the hair of the woman coming – This was exactly the way they felt when Johnson unhooked the storm door with that delicacy of thumb and forefinger you need for such gadgets and as though he was unfastening a brassiere from the bulge-back of the house. Wild children opened the door; there was a lot of stumbling over things on the porch floor but Cody never dreamed that one of the crazy little giggling girls who had been sent by the gals to open up while they brush up the last wave was Joanna Dawson his future wife. In America it’s always two girls and one is always older and uglier than the other, except in this case it was more accurate[…]”
