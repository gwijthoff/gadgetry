  <strong>Quote:</strong> “I think that many an officer, when he first studies the mooring board at the Naval Academy, or rather when he is supposed to study it, is at once impressed with its resemblance to a huge spider web, contrived by the devilish ingenuity of man for the purpose of hopelessly enmeshing the poor fly–which is himself.  […]  In either case, if the ship has to shift berth, the tendency is to damn the mooring board as an impracticable ‘gadget,’ and to fail to criticize the manner of its use.  Thus when it comes to a consideration of the less obvious manuvering problems, he is prone to dismiss the whole matter with the assertion tha, like the Peace of God, it ‘passeth all understanding.’  […]  When speaking of mooring board problems, I think not so much of the board itself as of the kind of work involved.  Such problems may be worked out on the actual board, or in many cases on a chart, or perhaps on some kind of specially contrived ‘gadget.’ […]  I have a gadget I use for maneuvering problems instead of the printed forms, locally known as the ‘Wegee Board,’ because it is supposed to predict the future and explain the past.  It is a sheet of white celluloid with an 18”circle on it graduated in degrees.  At the center is the point of a thumb tack inserted from the bottom side and filed down till it barely projects above the board.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “An Industrial Expert Tells Why Manufacturers Must Seek New Inventions to Keep Their Wheels Turning.  […]  “‘Our experience with inventors and with manufacturers indicates that there is a tremendous amount of inventive effort going to waste.  A great deal of free-lance inventing means that the poor inventor spends a vast amount of time and thought and often hard-earned savings working up some useless gadget that nobody will have.  “The inventor must realize that the first requisite of any new invention is that there be a possibility of broad human need underlying it, and ma­ chinery for its distribution that can be made to turn without spending a small fortune.        Let him remember the really outstanding inventions and think of them not as mechanical creations but as things that made it possible for humanity to ride where it had walked; to bridge space with conversation where it formerly required days to transmit messages.  /  Let him remember Gillette’s safety razor. The money on this invention has been made not through the razor but the blades.  /  Gillette’s funda­mental idea from which that invention sprung was that he wanted to get something for which there would be un­ limited repeat business. His hitting upon a blade that could be used and thrown away was a real stroke of genius.  /  This element of need is the thing that has been fundamental in inventions which have won commercial success.  Before he spends a lot of time, therefore, let the inventor check up on the potential market.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “During the few months of delay required by Henry to get his factory force and his advertising force and his sales force organized, expectation and curiosity rose high.  Nobody knew what the gadget was to be, except that it was rumored that it was to be extremely gadgetish.  Henry, in the meantime, cleverly whetted the public curiosity by putting up along the most frequented monkey-paths in the jungle signs such as these:  BRING SUNSHINE IN TO THE FAMILY NEXT / BUY A GADGET – AND IT DOES THE REST.  A COCOANUT, A COCOANUT, A COCOANUT A DAY / WILL BUY YOUR WIFE A GADGET AND KEEP THE FROWNS AWAY.”  turns out to be a cocoanut opener:  “The Guenon Perfection Automatic Cocoanut Decapitator.”  “It was so much more esthetic to have neatly decapitated cocoanuts, instead of the old kind that merely had their tops bashed in with a rock, that no self-respecting monkey-family dared serve any other kind.  And besides that, the gadget was such fun to play with.  Many a previously-industrious husband would stay at home half the morning fooling with the Decapitator when he ought to have been out picking cocoanuts for the support of his family.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Our man in charge of detecting trade-marks reports a wide-spread craze for compounds ending in “matic.”  The word ‘automatic’ is presumably the father to these coinages, since they all seem intended to carry a connotation of self-propulsion.  It is not a new idea.  Oil-O-Matic, which may have been the first, has been the trade-mark for the Williams oil burner for a number of years.  Within the last twelve months or so, however, the style has suddenly and for no apparent reason become extravagantly popular.  /  The automobile industry has been particularly prolific along these lines.  One manufacturer feathers the Hydramatic drive, another the Electromatic clutch, another Powermatic shifting, a fourth the Simplimatic transmission.  The newest models bring the Liquimatic drive and the Turbo-matic drive.  /  The vogue is also extensive in the electrical appliance field.  Examples include the Vis-O-Matic, Aire-Matic and Attach-O-Matic sweepers; the Laundrimatic, Spira-Matic and ABC-O-Matic washers; the Electro-Matic and Touch-O-Matic radios.  There is a Tel-A-Matic iron, and also an Adjust-O-Matic and a Steam-O-Matic.  The Ade-O-Matic keeps things warm on the Center-Matic stove while the Coffeematic processes the java.  Workers in industry ply Multi-matic and Camatic tools, while the Shift-o-matic is an electric typewriter carriage return.  /  Miscellaneous adaptations privilege the consumer to ride on Seal-O-Matic inner tubes; to sit hygienically in a Postur-Matic chair; to wear Glide-O-Matic arch resters while pushing a baby cab equipped with an Adjustmatic gear.  What’s more you can painlessly purchase any or all of the above articles on the Buy-O-Matic loan plan.  And if there is anything left for taxes, you can figure the amount with the Tax-O-Matic income tax chart.  /  It could have been considered inevitable that somebody would come up with Matho-Matic.  Sure enough, somebody did.  It’s the name for the nozzle on the Premier vacuum cleaner.  So far as we know, Roomatic remains unclaimed.  /  P.S.  At this very moment, Junior may be at large with the recently introduced Squirt-O-Matic water pistol.”

Women are among the most enthusiastic members of the Gadget-of -the-Month Club.”  Later, ad for “war surplus gadgets, heater relays, radio test filaments, electric trains, house chimes, etc.”  Ad for “Gadget Mix,” $1.19 a bag.

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “A gadget is a device for doing something that nobody knew needed doing until a gadget was invented to do it.  As Actor Clifton Webb found out, discovering what a new gadget actually does is not always easy.  When Don Davis of the Gadget-of-the-Month Club of Los Angeles, Calif., which sends a gimmick monthly to half a million subscribers, handed Webb the enigmatic tubular gizmo shown here, Webb was nonplused.  Nevertheless he accepted the challenge of figuring out what it was.  For 20 minutes he struggled manfully to make it do something useful without ever tumbling to its real purpose.  He twisted it and turned it, applying it to various parts of his anatomy with no success.  Finaly he even tried to make it fit his dog.  Then, baffled and frustrated, he gave up.  But Webb did learn the doodad’s proper use eventually, just as can anyone else by turning the page.” … “It’s a bathtub cane to prevent oldsters, cripples and cautious people from slipping.  Impressed with what he saw, Webb wanted one for his mother.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Technological innovations have been as important as language, art and science in distinguishing man from beast.  And although technological innovation antedates our species, it has never before occupied so great a share of man’s energies.  /  Our works are built on old foundations––on obsolete inventions such as the hand-ax and the bow no less than on inventions that have survived, such as agriculture and the wheel.  But during most of human history technological art accumulated gradually.  Up to a few hundred years ago, the techniques of civilized life had scarcely advanced beyond the best achievements of the ancients.  Then our control over the forces of nature began to increase at an explosive rate.  […]  In this article we shall examine some recent advances to see what light they throw on the creative process in the complex of technology today.  What do we mean by technological innovation?  Surely not the tail fins on this year’s automobile, nor a new catch on a refrigerator door.  A true innovation must perform some important function.  It may do a wholly new job or do an old job far better or far more cheaply than it was done before.  […]  …I will discuss some reasonably noncontroversial innovations made at the Bell Telephone Laboratories, where I am employed, under circumstances which I believe I understand.  […]  As our final example of innovation in technology let us consider briefly the microwave-relay system which carries telephone conversations and television programs across the country without the use of cables.  The key word here is ‘system.’  The problem was not to make a particular device, but to weld a great number of devices into a complex whole.  Some of the deices were available at the start; others had to be developed.  But the chief innovation was the choice, among the many alternative methods and devices, of the best combination of methods and devices–the system as a whole, and not merely its adequate parts.  […]  [Harold T.] Friis’s main problem, then, was not to invent this gadget or that, but to choose the best course, technically and economically, among a bewildering array of possibilities.  The art of making such a choice is usually called systems engineering when the alternative means and the required knowledge are all at hand.  When they are not, I suppose it should be called systems research.  By 1948 the results of the research of Friis and his colleagues had been embodied in an experimental system which was installed between New York and Boston.  This was the prototype of the transcontinental microwave system, which was put into service in 1951.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Never have Snow’s twin warnings, of the danger of thinking that one weapon will solve our problems, and of the illusion that one can rely on maintaining technical superiority, been more vividly illustrated by the early years of nuclear weapons.  Here the euphoria both of gadgets and of secrecy reached their highest and most disastrous intensity.  Through a blind obeisance to a single weapon the West let down the strength of its conventional forces and failed even to develop prototypes of modern weapons for land warfare.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The situation is particularly alarming in view of the vested  interests  that already exist  with  respect  to  the  development and sale of privacy-invading devices and procedures.  Perhaps  even  more  alarm­ing  are  two  attitudes  that,  it  seems  to me, underlie  the speed with which some of  the  privacy-invading  practices have taken  root, and  that  are  likely  to  be  the basis for a continuing demand for them. The first attitude can be characterized as an infatuation with gadgets and procedures that appear, at least to the layman, to be scientific.  This attitude seems to lead people to fit problems and objectives to the tools that happen to be available.  The second attitude, encouraged by an all too human desire to avoid personal responsibility for decisions is a preference for data and procedures that lend themselves to mechanization, in the belief that the elimination of human judgment is in itself desirable.  I am reminded here of what the late Norbert Wiener used to say (as far back as 1950) with regard to the use of computers.  He stressed that the greatest danger lies in our delegating to computers, out of ignorance or mental laziness, decisions that should remain ours.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “This brings me to the crux of my argument. Throughout the phase of history which we have come to survey, till very recently, to be a scientist was a calling, not a job. Scientists were men of science, not just men in science. They had come to science driven by an inner urge, curiosity, a quest for knowledge, and they knew, or learned, what it was all about. They were not drawn or lured into science in masses by fascinating gadgets, public acclaim, manpower needs of industries and governments, or job security; nor did they just drift in for no good reason. The scene, however, is now changing rapidly. The popularity and needs of an expanding science bring in more drifters and followers than pioneers.  […]  What were their guides; Ideas, not gadgets, not the need to publish. Ideas, in turn, sprout from the fertile soil of experience.”

But the silliest thing I have ever seen in golf is the headcover that goes with the ball retriever. One I saw was made of glove leather, like an Italian shoe, and. was used to protect a retriever made of anodized aluminum, a material that wouldn’t rust if you left it for twenty years in the Great Salt Lake.”
