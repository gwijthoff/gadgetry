  <strong>Strong, C.L., 1960.</strong> “Some months ago I added a gadget to the tunnel which considerably broadens its utility as a scientific tool.  This consists simply of an electric door bell (with the gong removed) and a chamber with a diaphragm inserted in the smoke circuit just ahead of the ‘rake.’  When properly adjusted, the door-bell-and-diaphragm assembly acts as a chopper to send the smoke out into the tunnel in small puffs or pulses instead of in a continuous stream”

  <strong>Newman, James R., 1960.</strong> “Wiener is a fluent writer, but this is not much of a novel.  It has some merit as social criticism, it describes ingeniously the technical stuff (control gadgetry) and the patent and corporate chicaneries one can get away with in our society, but the hero is a cold fish, a sort of Armenian trader whom one never gets either to like or to understand.”

  <strong>Blackett, P.M.S., 1960.</strong> “Never have Snow’s twin warnings, of the danger of thinking that one weapon will solve our problems, and of the illusion that one can rely on maintaining technical superiority, been more vividly illustrated by the early years of nuclear weapons.  Here the euphoria both of gadgets and of secrecy reached their highest and most disastrous intensity.  Through a blind obeisance to a single weapon the West let down the strength of its conventional forces and failed even to develop prototypes of modern weapons for land warfare.”

  <strong>Butterfield, Herbert, 1960.</strong> “The first of the sciences to be placed on a modern footing––that of anatomy–– was one which the artists cultivated and which was governed by direct observation.  It was the artists who even set up the cry that one must not be satisfied to learn from the ancients or to take everything from books; one must examine nature for oneself.  The artists were often the engineers, the designers of fortifications, the inventors of gadgets; they were nearer to the artisan than were the scholars, and their studios often had the features of a laboratory or workshop.  […]  Science and craftsmanship, combined with the state of the market, enabled them, however, to indulge their zeal for gadgets, mechanical improvements and inventions.”

  <strong>Rossman, Michael, 1961.</strong> “Also, who is to judge at the outset whether a gadget invention is not worthy of a patent?  The telephone, telegraph, movie, radio and television were regarded as mere ‘gadgets’ in their early stages. In fact, nearly all basic inventions must necessarily go through the ‘gadget’ stage.  The Patent Office policy of resolving doubts in favor of the inventor is thus sound.  It encourages investment which promotes industrial progress.”

  <strong>Mazia, Daniel, 1961.</strong> “If mitosis is not desperately discouraging as a problem of molecular biology, it is because the complex operations are embodied in a definite structural assembly––the mitotic apparatus––that can be regarded as a gadget for performing the operations.  We can approach the physics and chemistry of mitosis through the study of the formation, structure and changes of the mitotic apparatus, without forgetting that mitosis is an operation of the whole cell.”

  <strong>Glenn, John, 1962.</strong> “This is Friendship Seven. Turned around, yawed 180 [degrees] to see the sunrise here, and also to see these little, these little gadgets here that I don’t know what they are.  …  They do not seen, to be coming from the capsule at all. There are too many of them. They’re all spread out all over the place; it looks like they’re some of them might be miles away.”

  <strong>Cook, Fred J. , 1962.</strong> “The holdup killers, shooting up the town and spreading tack’s on the road behind them to hinder pursuit, made, good their escape. As chance would have it, the South Braintree crime occurred at the precise moment when Chief Stewart, Pinkerton? agents and immigration’ inspectors were turning up some curious angles that, Chief Stewart felt, might be related to the Bridgewater holdup - attempt. The Pinkertons had located an improbable witness who claimed to have invented a crime machine. One look into this unlikely gadget, according to, the inventor, would tell you just who committed any given crime. The Pinkertons, skeptical people, weren’t very interested, in the crime machine, but they were decidedly interested in the gossip its’ creator had’ picked Up in the Italian, community. AcCOrding to this, the men involved in the Bridgewater holdup attempt had been Italian anarchists who had been living in a shack near, the Fore River Shipyard in Quincy.)”

  <strong>Scheerer, Martin, 1963.</strong> “Each subject was told that his task was to transport all the weights in the wagon from one side of a table (‘Lawrence’) to the other side (‘Topeka’), that the wheels must roll freely, that he could make as many trips as he wished and that there were no hidden tricks or gadgets on the wagon––that its rolling was a function of the among of weight in it.”

  <strong>, 1965.</strong> “KENNETH  D.  ROEDER  (“Moths and  Ultrasound”)  is  professor  of  physi­ology  at  Tufts  University,  where  he has  served  since  1931.  He  was  born in  England,  was  graduated  from  the University of Cambridge and did gradu­ate  work  there and at the University  of Toronto.  “My  lifelong  interest  in  in­sects,”  he  writes,  “probably  stems  from a  childhood  enthusiasm  for  butterfly collecting.”  Roeder’s research deals mainly  with  the  biological  aspects  of insect behavior.  In addition he is “an incurable  tinkerer  with  mechanical  and electronic gadgets,” an activity that “led at  one  time  to  the  construction  of  an electromechanical  analogue  of  certain phases  of  cockroach behavior  and  has played a part in the work on moth hear­ing.”  He  says he has “always felt that if one can make a  subject  clear  and inter­esting  to  a  nonspecialist,  it  becomes clearer and more interesting to oneself.”

  <strong>Beranek, Leo L., 1966.</strong> “Apartment hunters have been known to carry portable radios with them so that they can test the noise transfer from one apartment to the next.  Some owners of cooperative apartments are compelled to spend large sums to insulate their dwellings more satisfactorily against the noise of their neighbors. […] In Europe long experience in apartment living and a popular taste for gracious living (in preference to gadgets) have led to careful attention to noise control in the construction of multiple-family dwellings.  Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden and the U.S.S.R. have well-developed acoustical building codes that have been applied to the large-scale program of rebuilding of housing since World War II.”

  <strong>Smith, Cyril Stanley, 1967.</strong> “Presenting an issue on materials in two aspects: (1) the fundamental nature of metals, ceramics, glasses, polymers and composite materials and (2) the properties that all materials possess in varying degrees. […] The tools, guns, gadgets and cathedrals of the Middle Ages, the instruments for the rise of modern science, the machines and structures of the 19th-century engineers––all were made of materials that had been known centuries before the rise of Greece.”

  <strong>Ehrenberg, W., 1967.</strong> “Smoluchowski’s  point  can  be  better appreciated by translating it into modern terms. Although he refers to recent progress  in  electronics,  ideas  such  as  the  rectification  of  an  alternating  voltage  had barely arisen in his time. Today the principle of rectification plays a major role in such  solid-state  electronic  devices  as  diodes  and  transistors.  These  devices  are analogous  to  the  hypothetical  gadgets that  translate  the  up-and-down  movement of a Brownian particle into a purely upward  motion,  or  that  perform  the  old demon’s trick of permitting only fast molecules to go from left to right.”
  <br />
  <br /></p>

<p><strong>Benedict, James, 1968.</strong> “French, in borrowing the English word ‘gadget’, lays far more stress than English-speakers generally do on the connotation for which a gadget is an object, such as a novelty item, with no function or use value.  It is with this emphasis that the author uses the term here and throughout the present work.” (7)  And as for using the word “gizmo”:  “I have hused ‘gizmo’ for the French catch-all term ‘machin,’ whose close kinship to the French ‘machine’ is thus not apparent in the English (123)”
  <br />
  <br /></p>

<p><a href="/tags/need"> <i class="fa fa-heart" style="color:red"></i></a>
  <strong>Fano, R. M., 1968.</strong> “The situation is particularly alarming in view of the vested  interests  that already exist  with  respect  to  the  development and sale of privacy-invading devices and procedures.  Perhaps  even  more  alarm­ing  are  two  attitudes  that,  it  seems  to me, underlie  the speed with which some of  the  privacy-invading  practices have taken  root, and  that  are  likely  to  be  the basis for a continuing demand for them. The first attitude can be characterized as an infatuation with gadgets and procedures that appear, at least to the layman, to be scientific.  This attitude seems to lead people to fit problems and objectives to the tools that happen to be available.  The second attitude, encouraged by an all too human desire to avoid personal responsibility for decisions is a preference for data and procedures that lend themselves to mechanization, in the belief that the elimination of human judgment is in itself desirable.  I am reminded here of what the late Norbert Wiener used to say (as far back as 1950) with regard to the use of computers.  He stressed that the greatest danger lies in our delegating to computers, out of ignorance or mental laziness, decisions that should remain ours.”

  <strong>Kreiling, Frederick C., 1968.</strong> “He functioned at one time or another, and often simultaneously, as political theorist, diplomat, engineer, inventor of gadgets and house historian for German princely families”
  <br />
  <br /></p>

<p><a href="/tags/rig"> <i class="far fa-lightbulb" style="color:red"></i></a>+instrument
  <strong>Philip, Phylis Morrison, 1968.</strong> “The pages present succinct descriptions, drawings and photographs of about three dozen marvelous gadgets from the heroic history of technology, all realized as working models.  There is no attempt to follow scale, materials or finish in authentic detail; the aim is to abstract and exhibit the ‘particular go’ of each machine.  Most of the devices are to be made at the woodworker’s bench, with some sheet-metal, plastic, rope or hardboard parts.  A number call for machined metal gearing that is beyond amateur skills; one can criticize the absence of much effort here to help young people take advantage of the rich marketplace of manufactured parts in our technological era.  The book is nonetheless a pleasure and a challenge.  Who would not like to see working models of the device used to generate screw threads without copying any existing thread; of the chinese spoon-tilt hammer, an automatic water-power scheme still familiar in Japanese gardens, or of the cornish man-engine, a vertical moving belt of miners, forerunner of the mine hoist?”

<p><strong>, 1969.</strong> “Nance  was  gradu­ated  from  Vanderbilt  University  with  a degree  in  English.  He  writes:  “After  an exposure  to  the  fascination  of  electronic gadgetry  during  service  in  the Air  Force I changed  fields and  studied physics and mathematics  at  Purdue  University.  For seven  years  I  was  a  research  engineer with  General  Motors,  finally  combining my  two  loves-words  and  gadgets-as  a technical editor.”
