  <strong>Cherry-Garrard, Aspley, 1910.</strong> “Further, at Cape Evans there had been running for more than three months a scientific station, which rivaled in thoroughness and exactitude any other such station in the world.  I hope that later a more detailed account may be given of this continuous series of observations, some of them demanding the most complex mechanism, and all of the watched over by enthusiastic experts.  It must here suffice to say that we who on our return saw for the first time the hut and its annexes completely equipped were amazed; though perhaps the gadget which appealed most to us at first was the electric apparatus by which the cook, whose invention it was, controlled the rising of his excellent bread.”

  <strong>Japp, Henry, 1912.</strong> “Fig. 14 shows method of erecting the segments on the upper quarter.  The segments were attached to the erector bar by a gadget with a large nut on one plain screwed end, and a flanged spigot on the other; the nut was run back far enough to insert the gadget, and the nut was spun by hand very quickly to lock it in place.  This is a very effective way of lifting the segments and saved the expense of casting iron lugs on each segment.  The cast iron in the four tunnels represents about 100,000 tons; each segment weight about one ton, so about 100,000 lugs were saved.”

  <strong>Bacon, Gertrude, 1915.</strong> “There are rival methods of achieving this end, some constructors (among them Orville Wright in America) seeking to attain it by ‘automatic’ and others by ‘inherent’ stability.  The latter speak disrespectfully of the devices of the former; they call them ‘gadget’ stabilizers.  The word is a trifle obscure, inasmuch as ‘gadget’ is the sea term for any miscellaneous article which does not appear to have a definite name, or at least one which comes ready at the moment.  I asked a famous expert the other day to define a ‘gadget stabilizer,’ and he did s promptly and forcibly as ‘any old thing which you hang on.’  Less picturesquely an automatic stabilizer is some means of giving stability, such as a gyroscope or a pendulum, which is put to a machine, and is not in itself an essential part of its construction.  /  The inherent stability people maintain that by careful design and constructino alone, by theorist and practical man working side by side, by scientific disposal of weights and surfaces, different tendencies may be made to balance and correct each other, one set of oscilations to damp out another, and so the perfect machine be evolved.  Further they have proved their point by succeeding.  The naturally stable machine is no dream of to-morrow but the realization of to-day; not sprung upon us in a moment by some fresh epoch-making discovery, but now arrived at as the consummation of the labours which began with the earliest pioneers.”

  <strong>, 1916.</strong> “There seems to be, or have been, three devices for accomplishing this result, i.e.:  1st, The Churchill ‘Gadget.’  2nd, The new Nesbit ‘Standard’ Compress.  3rd, The Webb High Density Attachment.  The first (Churchill ‘Gadget’) does not seem to be actively offered and is apparently not a live prospect.  The second (Nesbitt Press) is a new style of compress, the process of which differs somewhat from the compress in general use.  They ahve one or two plants in experimental operation.  The third (Webb High Density Attachment) is intended for use in connection with their regular compresses.  The Webb compress is in general use and their attachment is in successful operation at a number of places.”

  <strong>Bartimeus, 1917.</strong> “The First Lieutenant came quickly to the rescue.  ‘Of course,’ he said, ‘that’s all rot.  We’re only too grateful to––to Science for trying to invent a new gadget.… Only, you see, sir, in the meanwhile, until you hit on it we feel we aren’t doing so badly-–er––just carrying on.”
  <br />

<p><strong>de Gramont, Armand Antoine Agénor, 1918.</strong> “GADGET, dispositif (m) [servant à un usage quelconque.”
  <br />
  <br /></p>

<p><strong>Burke, Thomas, 1919.</strong> “As a born Cockney, living close to London every minute of my life, I had not noticed the slow change in the face and soul of London.  […]  The young men having gone to war, the streets were filled with middle-aged women of thirty, in short skirts, trying to attract the aged satyrs, the only men that remained, by pretending to be little girls.  […]  The common Cockney seemed to walk almost fearfully about his invaded streets, hardly daring to be himself or talk his own language.  apart from the foreign tongues, which always did annoy his ear, foul language now assailed him from every side:  ‘no bon,’ ‘napoo,’ ‘gadget,’ ‘camouflaged,’ ‘buckshee,’ ‘bonza,’ and so on.  This is not good slang.  Good slang has a quality of its own–a bite and spit and fine expressiveness which do not belong to dictionary words.  That is its justification–the supplying of a lacking shade of expression, not the supplanting of adequate forms.  The old Cockney slang did justify itself, but this modern army rubbish, besides being uncouth, is utterly meaningless, and might have been invented by some idiot schoolboy:  probably was.”
