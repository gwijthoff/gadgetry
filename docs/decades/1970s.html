  <strong>Philip, Phylis Morrison, 1970.</strong> “The  pace  is  lively  and  the  tone sure. Ancient bureaucracy gets no char­ity  from  Hodges;  weighing  very  lightly a good deal of evidence, he is committed to the superior inventiveness of unstable periods  in  history.  Materials  engage  his interest  most  easily;  it  is  clear  that  he prefers  chemistry  to  physics.  One  mar­velous  gadget  is  a  bronze sickle with  a wooden  handle  cunningly  fitted  to  the user’s thumb and fingers that  “would un­doubtedly  win  an  award  at  any  design center.”  It was  made  by an  alpine peas­ant craftsman  3,000 years ago.”
  <br />
  <br /></p>

<p>system
  <strong>Connolly, Stephen and Peter Shapiro, 1971.</strong> “[…] high-powered missile acquisition radar, used in tracking intercontinental ballistic missiles fired from Vandenberg, emanated lethal radiation throughout the area; needless to say, elaborate safety precautions for Navy personnel were not extended to the luckless Marshall Islanders. Today the Nike-Zeus system has been made obsolete by a more sophisticated nuclear gadget – the Nike-X defensive missile system (ABM). Kwajalein, now the site of a $165 million Missile Site Radar system (MSR) that serves as a seeing eye for ABM’s Spartan and Sprint defense missiles, participates in more than 15,000 operations a year.”

<p><a href="/tags/raygun"> <i class="fa fa-rocket" style="color:red"></i></a>
  <strong>Silverberg, Robert, 1972.</strong> “We do the serotonin diffraction in here. This room’s plasma research; remind me to bring you back sometime when the big centrifuge is running. Fascinating stuff. This is Klaus’s enzyme lab – I’d take you in, but he’s such a touchy bastard that there’s no sense provoking him needlessly – and down here… “ Harker puffed along behind the lab director, dazzled by the array of formidable and incomprehensible gadgetry, bewildered by the flow of unfamiliar terminology. He smiled a lot and tried to look as if he followed at least the rudiments. But he doubted that he was deceiving Raymond. He saw kennels where lively dogs bounded joyfully up and down and struggled to lick his hands through the cage; it was a little jarring to learn that every dog in the room had been dead at least once, from periods ranging from a few minutes to twenty-eight hours.”
  <br />
  <br /></p>

<p><a href="/tags/cog"> <i class="fa fa-cog" style="color:red"></i></a>
  <strong>Walker, Graham, 1973.</strong> “Beale engines perform in any orientation-vertical,  horizontal,  inclined or  upside  down.  They  are  amazingly simple  in  construction  and  do  not  depend  on  springs,  valves  or  any  kind  of mechanical gadget.”
  <br />
  <br /></p>

<p><a href="/tags/raygun"> <i class="fa fa-rocket" style="color:red"></i></a>
  <strong>Rhodes, Richard, 1974.</strong> “Subterrene is one of the more successful LASL programs, modest in cost and highly visible, a gadget that fulfills every little Leonardo’s dream and is practical as well. What a Subterrene can do is drill holes with its superhot “ penetrator “ in almost any kind of rock or soil and line them with their own “ glass “ pipes. The holes can be drilled vertically or horizontally or at any angle between, more practically and at less cost than most conventional holes, because the Subterrene turns the material that fills the hole into lava, which can then be extracted in several different forms.”
  <br />

<p><a href="/tags/wrinkle"> <i class="fa fa-bolt" style="color:red"></i></a>
  <strong>, 1975.</strong> “Try to conceive of the quantity of energy being wasted throughout the country by pilot lights on stoves burning 24 hours a day. Then hearken to this suggestion: Extinguish all pilot lights and seal them. As a substitute for them I remember my grandmother used a gadget, which to the best of my recollection is called a match.”
  <br />
  <br /></p>

<p><a href="/tags/rig"> <i class="far fa-lightbulb" style="color:red"></i></a>
  <strong>, 1976.</strong> “However, the third Alexander Calder demonstrated from his childhood an adventuresomeness and ingenuity that clearly marked him as no mere follower, even of his talented forebears.  Growing up in Arizona, California and New York, young ‘‘Sandy’ Calder tirelessly crafted playthings and other gadgets out of wire, wood and nails. In 1919 he graduated as an engineer from the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, N.J., then set out on an eccentric progression of technical jobs. As a boilerman on a passenger liner, he devised a contraption to direct sea breezes into the stifling engine room.”
  <br />
  <br /></p>

<p>tech
  <strong>Anthony, Piers, 1977.</strong> “Serena phoned. She was flying into Los Angeles and was free to spend the night with him, she said. He immediately canceled his other plans and agreed to collect her in three hours at the airport. Almost automatically, he asked where she was. “ There is no message, “ she whispered. Levanter took a taxi to the airport. He was half an hour early and dismissed the cab. He wandered through the lounges, watched the departing passengers lined up to pass through the gates of the electronic surveillance gadgetry, had a cup of coffee, and finally went to stand at the entrance of the terminal, where he was to meet her.”
  <br />
  <br /></p>

<p>instrument
  <strong>Gardner, Martin, 1978.</strong> “To teach arithmetic Peirce recom­mended the constant use of counters such as beans, the early introduction of binary notation, the use of 101 cards numbered 0 through 100 and other de­vices now common in grade school in­struction.  In one textbook he wanted to insert a cardboard mechanical gadget for doing multiplication. “The objection to inserting this,” he jotted in a note­book, “would be that the teachers would not understand the mathematical prin­ciple on which it depends, and might therefore be exposed to embarrassing questions.””
