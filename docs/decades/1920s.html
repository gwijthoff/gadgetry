  <strong>Haslett, Elmer, 1920.</strong> “Look for another match!’  I cried to Davis, and although he knew he had no more, he began to throw things out of his pockets right and left.  Among these things there fell a smudge cigarette lighter.  These instruments were devised by the French on account of their extreme shortage of matches.  The gadget consists of a tiny steel wheel, which strikes a piece of flint, which in turn ignites the smudge.  The only trouble with these things is that they do not always work.”
  <br />
  <br /></p>

<p><strong>Benchley, Robert, 1921.</strong> “And even then I was forced to stretch one leg out so far that I kicked a little gadget on a box arrangement on the dashboard, which apparently stopped the engine.”  [george blames it on him, says he did it on purpose.]  “As if I, with no mechanical instinct whatever, knew what was in that box!  I don’t know even now, and I have got my driver’s license.”
  <br />
  <br /></p>

<p><strong>Leroy, Oliver, 1922.</strong> “AFFUTIAU, sb. m.  1.  trinket, article of adornment.  Les jeunes filles aiment les affutiaux, girls are fond of titivating.  Des affutiaux comme en aiment les jeunes paysannes, just the sort of fal-lals peasent girls like.  2.  Thing, gadget.  Je ne sais plus le nom de cet affutiau, I don’t remember the name of that gadget.”
  <br />
  <br /></p>

<p><a href="/tags/tool"> <i class="fa fa-wrench" style="color:red"></i></a>
  <strong>, 1923.</strong> “It is inexcusable folly to have something go wrong 50 miles from nowhere, and then wish vainly that you had purchased some badly needed gadget before you started.  A collapsible bucket, for example, is almost indispensable if the engine overheats and the water boils away.  An extra gallon or so of oil and five gallons of gasoline are other factors of safety.”
  <br />
  <br /></p>

<p><a href="/tags/tool"> <i class="fa fa-wrench" style="color:red"></i></a>
  <strong>, 1924.</strong> “Handy Gadgets for the Amateur Gardener.  All those who have gardens know the fatigue pursuant to kneeling when any operation is required near the surface of the ground.  From England we have a kneeling mat which seems to solve the problem very effectually.  It is made of rush or straw and the bottom is water-proofed so that the damp and dew will not strike through.  These pads are very extensively used in England.”
  <br />
  <br /></p>

<p><a href="/tags/gauge"> <i class="fa fa-tachometer-alt" style="color:red"></i></a>
  <strong>Klemin, Alexander, 1925.</strong> “The famous Handley Page slotted wing, shown diagrammatically in our sketch, when open actually increases the maximum lift between fifty and seventy percent!  Its incorporation involves many mechanical difficulties, and aeronautical engineers always like to leave their wings free of all ‘gadgets’ or complications.  Nevertheless, this tremendous increase in lift may very well be utilized one day either to diminish landing speeds or to increase the carrying capacity of our planes.”
  <br />
  <br /></p>

<p><a href="/tags/gauge"> <i class="fa fa-tachometer-alt" style="color:red"></i></a>
  <strong>, 1926.</strong> “Well, gimme the works, and I’ll show you how it’s done [wiring a “spotlight” to the car], and then when you buy a cigar lighter or some other gadget in another town, where they haven’t a good-natured garageman to wire it for you, you can do the job yourself.”
  <br />
  <br /></p>

<p><a href="/tags/placeholder"> <i class="fa fa-spinner fa-pulse" style="color:red"></i></a>
  <strong>Beard, Charles Austin and Marry Ritter Beard, 1927.</strong> “After the long and toilsome rise, American civilization had reached, at the summer solstice of Normalcy, the high plateau of permanent peace and prosperity.  […]  Notes of jubilee drowned the plaintive cries of farmers and the queasy doubts of querulous critics.  According to the golden appearance of things, intensity would create novelty upon novelty, gadget upon gadget, to keep the nation’s machine whirling; inevitably outlets would be found for the accumulations of capital and the torrents of commodities; and employment would be afforded for laborers befitting their merits and diligence.  Articles for comfort and convenience, devices for diversion and amusement were multiplying with sensational rapidity, giving promise of a satisfaction even more gratifying.  Corporations were swelling in size, holding companies were rising to dizzy heights, the tide of liquid claims to wealth were flooding in.”
  <br />
  <br /></p>

<p><a href="/tags/rig"> <i class="far fa-lightbulb" style="color:red"></i></a>
  <strong>, 1928.</strong> “On the Memphis, coming back from Paris, Slim [LIndbergh’s nickname] rigged up a gadget to work a shower bath from the outside.  He tried it first on a newspaperman who, fully clothed and expecting to get a ‘human interest’ item out of the ‘invention’ Slim asked him to inspect, stepped under the shower and got literally ‘all wet’ when Lindbergh pulled the string.”
  <br />
  <br /></p>

<p><a href="/tags/tool"> <i class="fa fa-wrench" style="color:red"></i></a>
  <strong>, 1929.</strong> “The pocket lighter, that little gadget which replaces matches and supplies a light for the cigar by a simple flip of the thumb–sometimes–has become so popular in this country that many varieties of cigar-stand filling stations have been devised.”
