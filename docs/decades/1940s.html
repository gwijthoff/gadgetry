  <strong>West-Sackville, Victoria, 1940.</strong> “What an odd little word ‘gadget’ is, almost a gadget in itself, so small and useful.  Its origin is obscure and is believed not to appear in print before 1886.  Yet it is not, as might be though, an Americanism.  It appears as an expression used chiefly by seamen, meaning any small tool, contrivance, or piece of mechanism not dignified by any specific name; a what-not, in fact; a chicken-fixing, a gill-guy, a timmey-noggy, a wim-wom.  I commend these agreeable synonyms to Mr. Clarence Elliott’s notice, and at the same time record my gratitude for his revival of that other sea-0faring word, manavlins.  I wonder how many English-speaking people are familiar with its meaning?” (197).    “I mistrust gadgets, generally speaking.  They seldom work.  The proved, old-fashioned tool is usually better and it is safer to stick to it.  I thus make a rule of throwing all tempting catalogues of gardening gadgets straight into the waste-paper basket, not daring to examine them first, because I know that if I examine them I shall fall.  It will mean only that I shall with some trouble obtain a postal order for 10s. 6d., to acquire an object which will speedily join similar objects rusting in the tool shed.  It should be clear from this that my mistrust of gadgets is equalled only by my weakness for them, and that no amount of experience can make me find them anything but irresistible” (196).  Among her favorite gadgets:  “Then there is the long narrow trowel of stainless steel and it s associate the two-pronged hand fork, both unrivaled for weeding in between small plants, though perhaps there is no tool so well adapted for this purpose as the old table knife with the stump of a broken plaid.” (196)  But the “perfect gadget” is the “widger” – “the neatest, slimmest, and cheapest of all gadgets to carry in the pocket.  Officially the widget is Patent No. 828793, but it owes (I believe) its more personal name to the ingenuity of Mr. Clarence Elliott, whose racy gardening style ought to be more widely appreciated.  He invented the widger, its name, and the verb to wig, which, although not exactly onomatopoeic, suggests very successfully the action of prising up–you wig up a weed, or wig up a caked bit of soil for the purpose of aerating it–all very necessary operations which before the arrival of the widget were sometimes awkward to perform.  This small sleek object, four inches long, slides into the pocket, no more cumbersome than a pencil, and may be put to many uses.  Screwdriver, toothpick, letter-opener, widger, it fulfils [sic] all functions throughout the day.  Its creator, Mr. Elliot, I observe, spells it sometimes with a ‘y’: wydger, no doubt on the analogy of Blake’s Tyger, just to make it seem more unusual.  Whatever the spelling, it is the perfect gadget” (197).  Next chapter, “Tool-shed”:  “Different from gadgets are the time-honored tools which hang in the dusty brown twilight of the tool-shed when their day’s work is done.  The wood of their handles is as tawny as the arms of men who use them: the have a sun-burnt air.  The steel of spuds, forks, and trowels glistens quietly as though it were resting; it has been in contact with the earth all day, and recalls the old expedient of plunging a dirty knife-blade into the soil and withdrawing it restored to a brightness like the flash of Excalibur.  The prongs of forks are burnished as bayonets, the curve of hooks gleaming as sabers.  The big wooden trudges repose peacefully across the handles of the barrow.  The long handles of rakes and hoes dangle in rows, symmetrical as Uccello’s lances.  There is a shelf with all the odd accumulation of labels, green string, hedging-gloves, old tobacco tins full of saved seeds.  A hank of yellow bass hangs from a nail, blond as corn.  The flower-pots are piled, tier upon tier, red as a robin’s breast.  Red and brown, green and golden, steely as armor, dusty as snuff, the tool-shed deepens in shadow as the respite of evening shuts the door and leaves the small interior to the mouse” (199).”

  <strong>Peck, James H.L., 1941.</strong> “Before you realize it the big Douglas C-39 transport is settling to earth. Here at the air depot are bigger and better hangars; better, in that they are equipped with most of the gadgets and machinery found in an aircraft factory, even to the expensive machine tools­ huge planers, millers, lathes, and grinders. Inside the hangar there are several craft in various stages of construction or destruction. The sergeant explains there are two classes of jobs done here at the de­ pot: FWT rebuilding jobs, and the reclamation of wrecks. FWT, he says, means “fair, wear and tear,” the wear due to normal service.”

  <strong>, 1942.</strong> “From now on we shall see a rapid development of electronic gadgeteering–the non-radio application of radio technique–according to Charley Golenpaul, of the Aerovox Corporation.  /  “I believe the era of electronic gadgeteering is now opening up in a big way,” states Mr. Golenpaul. “In the first place, the ban on amateur radio communications is not going to leave the enterprising ‘ham’ twirling his thumbs.  Of course many ‘hams’ are already or will soon be in our armed and technical services.  Many will find wartime jobs with other United Nations.  But those remaining on the home front are going to put their experience, equipment, and ambition to work on new and startling applications in the home, shop, factory, and elsewhere, far removed from customary radio practice.  /  “I suppose most radio men have heretofore been too busy with radio proper to find extra time and energy for non-radio or electronic gadgeteering possibilities. However, many of them now are going to use their ‘rigs’ and parts for new functions.  I can visualize some interesting developments – light-beam telephones for conversing over considerable distances; automatic photo-electric garage-door openers; photo-electric switches turning lights on and off with darkness or daylight; checking the stoking of furnaces or boilers by the chimney smoke; various comparators or instruments for comparing and matching colors and shades; checking solution concentrations and chemical studies by conductivity means; and so on.  /  “As a starter, electronic gadgeteer­ing can be based on well-known ele­mentary principles and basic circuits long known to radio amI electrical workers. Many industrial plants are already electronic-gadget conscious. I know of radio servicemen who’ve got­ ten themselves good jobs in plants he­ cause of their ability to do things better, quicker, and less expensively by electronic means.  /  “Make no mistake about it, the temporary suspension of ‘ham’ communications may well turn out to he a boost. It will generate a lively in­terest in electronic gadgeteering. And when ‘ham’ communications are re­sumed again with the return of peace, I venture to predict that electronic gadgeteering will comprise a greater field for radio parts, particularly the quality or extra-heavy-duty compo­nents, than all amateur radio activities put together. Furthermore, many a ‘ham’ will find an interesting way of making real money out of his hobby, and that’s something.””

  <strong>Ingalls, Albert G., 1943.</strong> ““These are the preliminary adjustments. When these are complete, I should start collimating from both ends, and meet in the middle. Insert the main mirror and line up so that the optical axis coincides with the cross-wires. Insert accurate cross-wires at the inner end of the declina­tion axis (c, Figure 1). A cap should be provided for the eyepiece adapter tube, with a small hole in the exact center. Such a cap can easily be made of tin, and is a very useful gadget.”  […]  Again, all this is largely of general interest, alone, to the average amateur, because the necessary furnace is seldom available.  Gemmill states that homemade blower could be rigged up with an oil burner and some sort of retort.  Again we have the intangible factor of fun pottering with gadgets, and when some too practical-minded critic comes along to remark, ‘Does it pay?’ you say ‘No,’–and go on pottering, leaving him shaking his head.  He will never understand the mainsprings of the experimental urge.””

  <strong>, 1944.</strong> “The Saturday morning session opened with an announcement by George Moore on the winners of the gadget contest.  A total of five gadgets was submitted but it is believed that if traveling conditions had been better a larger number would have been submitted because there is always considerable interest shown in this contest.  …  The winning gadgets submittd and their order in the contest are as follows:  /  The lime slacking machine sumbitted by Harold R. Fanning … who is Superintendent of Sanitation and Bendix Aviation Corporation, received first place.  /  The sludge sampler submitted by… received second place.  /  The diagram of the sludge sampler submitted … was third choice of the membership.  /  Following the announcement regarding the gadget contest winners, Morrish Cohn of Schenectady pointed out the need of this nation for more money to conduct this war and appealed to everybody to buy an extra War Bond in the Fifth War Bond Drive.”

  <strong>Huxley, Aldous, 1945.</strong> “That is why the would-be mystic is always told to refrain from busying himself with matters which do not refer to his ultimate goal, or in relation to which he cannot effectively do immediate and concrete good.  This self-denying ordinance covers most of the things with which, outside business hours, the ordinary person is mainly preoccupied–news, the day’s installment of the various radio epics, this year’s car models and gadgets, the latest fashions.  But it is upon fashions, cars and gadgets, upon news and the advertising for which news exists, that our present industrial and economic system depends for its proper functioning.  For, as ex-President Hoover pointed out not long ago, this system cannot work unless the demand for non-necessaries is not merely kept up, but continually expanded.”

  <strong>Whittaker, Wayne, 1946.</strong> “Now, with honorable discharge, some 20 basic plastics are back in civvies–but not the same youthful prewar civvies.  Plastics’ postwar garb is man-size stuff worthy of materials that can swing their weight around in the industrial big leagues.  …  In view of these facts, can you blame the industry for being a little irate over any interpretation of plastics as something out of which lipstick holders and all sorts of gadgets are made?  …  ‘Let’s not talk about new plastic gadgets,’ pleaded a spokesman for the Dow Chemical Company recently.  ‘Every manufacturer is being pushed at the present time to produce enough plastics for practical purposes.””

  <strong>, 1947.</strong> “No gadget pleases Mrs. Ostraberg [fictional family of the future] more than her company table cloth, which looks like a fine piece of damask but can be wiped of like oil cloth, if anything spills.  …  “Fred’s work in running the shoe-store is a satisfactory ‘creative outlet’;  he is usually content after work to relax.  The gadgets available for his relaxation are myriad, but he takes them less seriously than the Ostrabergs because to him they are relatively less important.  /  The Wilcoxes do not have fancy gadgets.  But fish are biting in Georgia as in Indiana…  In Georgia, of course, there are two races of people, white and black, and they do not always share the same sports or parks and playgrounds; but there is better provision for both races than there had been in 1940.  Wilcox can already count a good many improvements which have come about in 20 years.  Wilcox is a Negro.””

  <strong>Jones, Hilton Ira, 1948.</strong> “A new gadget enables a mother to give a child a shampoo without danger of getting soap in its eyes and consequently without the usual session of struggle and tears.  With this contraption the child reclines in a comfortable position while its mother has both hands free to do the shampooing.  The gadget can be placed on the kitchen drainboard, or in or over a bath tub.”

  <strong>, 1949.</strong> “A gadget is a device for doing something that nobody knew needed doing until a gadget was invented to do it.  As Actor Clifton Webb found out, discovering what a new gadget actually does is not always easy.  When Don Davis of the Gadget-of-the-Month Club of Los Angeles, Calif., which sends a gimmick monthly to half a million subscribers, handed Webb the enigmatic tubular gizmo shown here, Webb was nonplused.  Nevertheless he accepted the challenge of figuring out what it was.  For 20 minutes he struggled manfully to make it do something useful without ever tumbling to its real purpose.  He twisted it and turned it, applying it to various parts of his anatomy with no success.  Finaly he even tried to make it fit his dog.  Then, baffled and frustrated, he gave up.  But Webb did learn the doodad’s proper use eventually, just as can anyone else by turning the page.” … “It’s a bathtub cane to prevent oldsters, cripples and cautious people from slipping.  Impressed with what he saw, Webb wanted one for his mother.”
