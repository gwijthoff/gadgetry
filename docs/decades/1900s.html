  <strong>, 1900.</strong> “If your engine has a linking in gadget on the I.P. valve gear, it would be well to link it in a little, giving the I.P. a shorter cut off, and an increase of power in the I.P. cylinder would result and the H.P. would be decreased a corresponding amount, and the respective powers would even up to about 88 I.H.P. each.”

  <strong>Bullen, Frank T., 1902.</strong> “Before I had time to question him as to his meaning, the old man emerged from the cabin loaded with sundry strange-looking machines, and followed by the steward bearing more.  For a few minutes he was mighty busy placing his menagerie in order, and then he turned to me and said briskly, ‘Now, Mr. Roper, I’m all ready, go forrard and invite the hands aft to the lecture.’  […]  The skipper was as busy as two people about his wheels and things, and the unhappy steward like an image of fear obeyed mechanically the various commands of his dread master.  At last a whirring sound was heard like the humming of some huge imprisoned bee, and to this accompaniment the skipper took up his parable and preceded to talk.  […]  Indeed, from what I could see of their faces, I believe every other sense was merged in the full expectation of an explosion, and they couldn’t have taken their strained eyes off the buzzing gadget in their midst for any consideration whatever.”  a monkey rushes the apparatus, something explodes, then:  “‘Mr. Roper, I shan’t give any more scientific exhibitions this trip; I think they’re immoral.’  With that he hobbled into his cabin, and we saw no more of him for a week.  When we did, you couldn’t have got a grain of science out of him with a small-tooth comb…”

  <strong>, 1905.</strong> “But, as above stated, the methods of tying the cotton while under this extreme pressure as usually practiced are such that when the pressure is removed the bales expand until their density is only about 22.5 or 23 pounds to the cubic foot.  Various methods have been used to prevent this expansion, at least in part, and so produce a bale of greater density.  These methods seem to be practicable, though of varying utility, but they all involve increased expense.  Among them is the Gadget process, so called, an attachment by which wires are drawn tightly around the bale and twisted while the cotton is held between the jaws of the compress.  By this method a density of perhaps 30 to 35 pounds is retained, and bales of that density and consequently smaller size would apparently permit car loadings of 40,000 pounds and upwards.  To what extent the Gadget attachment is in actual use is not disclosed by the testimony.  […]  By the use of the Gadget attachment and similar devices a bale of still greater density is produced which loads readily 35,000 to 40,000 pounds.”

  <strong>, 1907.</strong> “an appliance to clean the bottom of the ship, without the necessity of dry-docking or employment of drivers.  It consists of an oblong structure armed with wire brushes, and looks very much like a door-mat.  This is pulled forwards and backwards by stout hawsers, made fast to the ship’s steam capstans.  It can be made to traverse any path the operator requires.  The bristles of the brushes are magnetised, so that they both attract themselves to the iron of the ship’s side and scrape as well.”  /  “It was wonderful to see how quickly the news spread round the ship that the electric scrubbing gadget was worried satisfactorily.”

  <strong>, 1908.</strong> “The chief, with an eye to curbing the speeding proclivities of the automobile set, purchased a motorcycle that was guaranteed to run like the dickens.  And it did, too, the first time the chief took the road.  Accidentally pressing the wrong gadget or something, the thing bounded away like a stung deer.”
