  <strong>, 1930.</strong> “Now we’ll give it a real good cleaning out, he said as he carried the radiator over to the washstand and attached a special fixture to the lower hose connection.  What’s that gadget? Backson inquired.  Latest thing to clean radiators, Gus replied.  Water goes in the big pipe and the little one is connected to the air pressure line.  Shooting the air in with the water in short bursts fills the radiator with a churning mixture of water and bubbles that loostens the sludge and rust lots better than the ordinary flushing out.”

  <strong>, 1931.</strong> “There is no question but that the American working man is our biggest customer. He knows that his net income is very much higher under the high wage system than under the other; his percentage of “luxury” or “pleasure” cash is much greater under the former than under the latter. He has, accordingly adjusted his standard of living to a scale higher than Europeans know or have known.  He has a car with all the necessary or foolish gadgets, a six- or eight- or ten-tube radio, good clothes, plenty of good food, and more comforts than a medieval king.”

  <strong>Schmidt, Robert and William Arnold Thorpe, 1932.</strong> “The small trinkets sometimes known as ‘gallantries’ are a minor phase of eighteenth-century culture, but not without their significance.  No material is more suitable than porcelain…”

  <strong>Ingalls, Albert G., 1933.</strong> “The equipment consists of a mail-order-house bench grinder and quarter horsepower motor, two Carborundum wheels and some Carborundum grains, two felt wheels and powdered pumice, a few small gadgets, a strong thumb and patience. The material is low­ priced mineral in the rough–moss agates, rose quartz, carnelian, jasper, chalcedony, tiger eye and so on–obtainable from mineral dealers, or often is most unpromising stones simply picked up while on country rocks.”

  <strong>, 1934.</strong> “Space permitting, we could list dozens of such things … ‘little things’ we have discovered in our pursuit of perfection in hotel service.  Clean, new pen points, both ‘stub’ and ‘fine’ … fresh, free-flowing ink … a pin cushion with its quick repair supply of buttons, pins and threaded needles … a gadget for hanging trousers properly … the convenient desk calendar … a telephone-attached memorandum pad, etc., etc.”

  <strong>Ingalls, Albert G., 1935.</strong> “This pamphlet includes a description of a needle (smaller than the one to be described here) and an outline of the conditions under which the test shall be conducted. It does not describe any machine. That is left to the ingenuity of the inventor. The responsibility for the design of the machine shown on the present page must rest with me. The credit for making a really workmanlike gadget of it is due to Mr. Frank Wanderer, a member of our local A.T.M. association.”

<p><strong>Devoe, Alan, 1936.</strong> “In reading through “the glossy pages of a large and costly monthly” magazine…  “In absorbed fascination I read these slyly contrived proffering of wares, and I became aware as I read these slyly contrived profferings of wares, and I became aware, as I read, that almost all the advertised products–although as physically various as ice-boxes and pens, underwear and cigar-lighters–had a certain common aspect.  Almost all of them, in a word, were gadgets.  /  A gadget is not easy to define.  It is a kind of what’s or thingumabob or dingus–all these excellent slang words being themselves, alas, rather nebulous and indefinable.  The fact that it is indefinable may be, I suspect, the clue to the gadget’s nature.  The gadget, in short, is a gadget; which is to say that it is not definable in terms of its relation to the real life and basic pursuits of man.  A ‘hat’ we may define; it is an object to keep the human head warm or dry or shaded or otherwise comfortable.  We may readily enough define food or drink or books or houses.  But the gadget…” (590)  * * * “I hear complaints and repinings now and again that in this age philosophy is dead.  But I do not think so.  There has simply been substituted, for other philosophies, the philosophy of the gadget.  This philosophy is but materialism carried to a somewhat attenuated but entirely logical extreme.  It is the ultimate, and rather pathetic, expression of acquisitiveness.  […]  We have deified gadgets, precisely as we have tended more and more to make material concerns for ultimates of our thinking.  For that modern temper which delights ‘to pay devout and uncritical obeisance to the analytic intelligence,’ disclaiming every other human faculty of apprehension, and which–being beset by economic woes–is obsessed by economic criteria of values, and by those alone, it would be hard to find a more fitting symbol and insignia than The Gadget.”  “That we seek to appease this gnawing sense of want and incompleteness by devising newer and queerer and more elaborate gadgets is not more ridiculous than sad.  It is part of the flight from reality, or rather, perhaps, of the refusal to face reality steadfastly and with full realization.”  Goes to a “dream of some day about the year 5000” when archaeologists explore “the subterranean ruins of a great twentieth-century city,” uncovering miserable tabloids chronicling war, “night clubs,” and the horrors of… ::gasp:: stand up comedy!  “And then, in this dream, I see the leader of the archaeological party pounce with delight upon a small object in the dust, and I hear him cry ‘Here is their sacred talisman, the symbol of their religion!’ and I see him hold up to his conferères a cigar-lighter with the recipes for eight cocktails printed on it, and with a fountain-pen at one end of it and a flashlight at the other.”

  <strong>, 1938.</strong> “If the summer now drawing to a close had any distinction fun-wise, it was in all the new and wonderful things people carried to the beach with them as a protection against the sun.  Nowhere was this display of luxury gadgets more concentrated than at the private beach clubs along the Atlantic seaboard.  At such places, at least, medical warnings against sunburn had had their effect on sunbathers who employed all manner of doodads to avoid blistering.”  an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch screen made of canvas and cellophane.  Sunshade that lays over eyes.  “Lewis &amp; Conger’s ‘sun-meter,’ a clocklike device which rings a bell after a set time to warn you to turn over like a squab on a spit.”  …  caption:  “With no gadgets at all this girl has a grand time just holding her hat on.”

<p><strong>, 1939.</strong> “He then introduced Vannevar Bush ‘15, President of the carnegie Institution and a former Vice-President of the Institute.  /  Dr. Bush talked on gadgets and gadgeteers, stating that they dated from Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin.  He described the telephone as one of the gadgets now fully developed.  ‘For a long time,’ he said,’ we all thought that…”
