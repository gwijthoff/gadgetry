  <strong>, 1950.</strong> “Regarding the “utility of the BC-221 frequency meter,” which can be “increased considerably by the addition of a null indicator that gives positive indication of exact zero beat between the crystal and the heterodyne oscillator or the signal from a near-by transmitter.  A 6E5 ‘magic eye’ tube can be added without circuit complications…”  “The addition of this gadget has made a big improvement in my BC-221, and it is hoped that others will be able to derive the same benefit…”  “Needing something in a hurry to replace a smashed neon bulb as an r.f. indicator, I connected a tN34 crystal diode across a 0-1 millimeter as shown at A in Fig. 2.  With the addition of a six-inch length of wire as a probe, the gadget can be used for numerous application”

<p><strong>Posnack, Emanuel R., 1951.</strong> “If a machine, apparatus, process, tool, gadget is not within the stated ‘constitutional scheme of advancing scientific knowledge’ [quoting Justice Jackson in A&amp;P decision], it is not deserving of patent protection.  It does not matter that it is new or useful–or that it has promoted the progress of the ‘useful arts’–or that it has added to human comfort or convenience–or that it has resulted in the investment of capital and the employment of labor–or in the addition of wealth.  If it adds nothing ‘to the total stock of knowledge,’ its manufacture, sale or use should not be encouraged by the special inducement of a limited patent monopoly.”

  <strong>Newman, James R., 1952.</strong> “Model Jets and Rockets for Boys, by Raymond F. Yates. Harper &amp; Brothers ($2.50). Mr. Yates gives a brief history of rockets, and then devotes several chapters to detailed instructions on how to build jet propelled aircraft, racing cars and boats, using ordinary house­ hold items and a few gadgets that can be purchased inexpensively. A complete jet engine that will run a model plane at 200 miles per hour costs only $1.95; fuel tanks can be made out of empty 35-milli­ meter film containers.  […]  Coggins and Pratt offer for a somewhat older age group an interesting account of the history and development of these fateful gadgets. Their book describes the tightly packed, powder-filled paper tubes used in the 13th century by the Chinese to frighten off the Mongolian invaders, the Congreve rockets the British lobbed into Baltimore in 1814.”

<p><strong>Rabinowitch, Eugene, 1953.</strong> “The Soviet thermonuclear explosion of August 12 may have been ‘weak,’ i.e., compared the first ‘thermonuclear experiment’ at Eniwetok in 1951, rather than to th full-fledged explosion achieved on November 1, 1952; and the latter itself may have been the try-out of an earth-bound ‘gadget’ rather than of a deliverable thermonuclear bomb.  It needs, however, little optimism–if optimism be the right word–to predict that the ‘gadget’ will soon be converted into an H-bomb capable of delivery by a bomber, and that a Soviet H-bomb will follow the American without much delay.”

  <strong>Cooper, William W., and Charnes, Abraham, 1954.</strong> “Like the theory of games, it is a method of pure mathematics that can be applied to human affairs.  It is used to calculate the best possible solution to a problem that involves a number of variables.  […]  To illustrate the method let us take a highly simplified hypothetical case.  We have a factory that can make two products, which for simplicity’s sake we shall name ‘widgets’ and ‘gadgets.’”

  <strong>Newman, James R., 1955.</strong> “Crabs, crayfish, and mussels are the octopus’ favorite foods, and it wants them alive.  IT is much better at opening a mussel than the most experienced human shucker armed with the latest Abercrombie and Fitch gadget.”

  <strong>McCafferty, Phil, 1956.</strong> “Farmers who have turned inventors to concoct ingenious machines get a chance to exhibit their creations at the annual Farm Gadget Show of the Iowa State Fair.  …  Sixteen-year-old Marvin Negley copped a prize for his drill press made from the rear-axle assembly of a junked car he found on his father’s farm.”

  <strong>, 1957.</strong> “He drinks little and smokes not at all.  He plays a little golf, is an enthusiastic photographer, seizes any chance to travel, particularly by car, and is a gadget devotee, whether the gadget be a dictating machine or a domestic labour-saver.  His interests all lie in the field of science, and the arts mean little to him.”

  <strong>Furth, Harold P., Morton A. Levine, Ralph W. Waniek, 1958.</strong> “With  high  electrical  power  one  can generate extremely strong  magnetic fields,  but  the  difficulty  is  that  such fields place  severe  strains  on  the coil,  or solenoid, as  it  is  called.  A magnetic field can  produce  both mechanical  and heat­ing  effects.  The  mechanical  effects  are illustrated  by  a  clever  gadget  known as Roguet’s  spiral.  It  is a  suspended  coil with  its  lower  end  dipping  into  a  bowl of  mercury.  When  a  current  passes through  the  coil,  the  magnetic  field around  the  loops  causes  the  adjacent turns  of  the  coil  to  be  attracted  to  each other  while  the  opposite  sides  of  each loop  repel  each  other.”

  <strong>Stann, Francis, 1959.</strong> “Pascual now is claiming for himself a new attitude.  ‘I’m really ready,’ he says.  ‘My arm feels better because of that machine.’  /  The ‘machine,’ according to Herb Heft, chief publicist of the Senators, isn’t quite ‘new.’  ‘It’s a gadget that our trainer, George Lentz, used on only two pitchers–Sid Hudson and Rae Scarborough,’ he explains.  ‘He’d put it away because nobody else had much confidence in it, but now Pascual thinks it’s the greatest invention since atomic energy.’  /  It’s merely a dusted-off gadget that vibrates with a rubber tip, Heft says, but it makes Pascual feel that the only-tired arm of a starting pitcher isn’t his own private hell the next day.”
