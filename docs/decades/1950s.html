<p><strong>, 1950.</strong> “Besides its many handsome diagrams and striking photographs, it possessed a side pocket containing a collapsible, multicolored dodecahedron (held to­gether by rubber bands which made it self-erecting when removed from its hid­ ing place), a set of motion-picture ‘cards which when rapidly riffled displayed cer­tain geometrical laws, a pair of red and green Cagliostro spectacles which con­ferred three dimensions on the book’s several anaglyphs, and a few other equally ingenious gadgets. Dr. Steinhaus’ introduction was so modest and amiable as to disarm all criticism. “You are right,” he said, “there is no system in this book; important things are omitted and trifles are emphasized. Many things do not deserve the name of mathematics, and the author himself does not seem to know what his aim really was in publish­ ing his ‘mathematical snapshots.’ They are too scientific for a child and too childish for a mathematician.” Still, this was excessively modest. For Steinhaus succeeded not only in serving up a re­ past of mathematical objects “as pecu­liar as the most exotic beast or bird,” but his book, for all its grab-bag disorder and despite the fact that his morsels rarely more than tickled the appetite for the strange and wonderful, afforded an amazing display of the richness, the va­riety and especially the interrelatedness of mathematical thought. His snapshots had a dual role. They were often beau­tiful and fascinating in themselves and from that standpoint it was unnecessary to ask what they meant. Yet they were also pictorial representations of purely abstract relations possessing universal validity. Thus they could illumine for the thoughtful reader something of the nature of intellectual process-how we are able to interpret the physical world and make coherent and useful systems describing its behavior. The very mish­ mash quality of the book serves to carry out this purpose.”

<p><strong>, 1950.</strong> “The attempts through the years to get a broader, looser conception of patents than the Constitution contemplates have been persistent.  The Patent Office, like most administrative agencies, has looked with favor on the opportunity which the exercise of discretion affords to expand its own jurisdiction.  And so it has placed a host of gadgets under the armor of patents – gadgets that obviously have had no place in the constitutional scheme of advancing scientific knowledge. A few that have reached this Court show the pressure to extend monopoly to the simplest of devices:  Hotchkiss v. Greenwood, 11 How. 248: doorknob made of clay, rather than metal or wood, where different shaped door knobs had previously been made of clay.  Rubber-Tip Pencil Co. v. Howard, 20 Wall. 498: rubber caps put on wood pencils to serve as erasers.  Union Paper Collar Co. v. Van Dusen, 23 Wall. 530: making collars of parchment paper where linen paper and linen had previously been used.  Page 340 U. S. 157  Brown v. Piper, 91 U. S. 37: a method for preserving fish by freezing them in a container operating in the same manner as an ice cream freezer.  Reckendorfer v. Faber, 92 U. S. 347: inserting a piece of rubber in a slot in the end of a wood pencil to serve as an eraser.  Dalton v. Jennings, 93 U. S. 271: fine thread placed across open squares in a regular hairnet to keep hair in place more effectively.  Double-Pointed Tack Co. v. Two Rivers Mfg. Co., 109 U. S. 117: putting a metal washer on a wire staple.”  etc. etc.  “The patent involved in the present case belongs to this list of incredible patents which the Patent Office has spawned. The fact that a patent as flimsy and as spurious as this one has to be brought all the way to this Court to be declared invalid dramatically illustrates how far our patent system frequently departs from the constitutional standards which are supposed to govern.”

  <strong>Ingalls, Albert G., 1950.</strong> “Well, I do it thisaway. The glass rotates while the template slides over it, back and forth. The linkage keeps the template always vertical. Throw on the abrasive and both glass and template automatically go paraboloid, the only curve we know of that can be made that way. Starting, say, with a hemisphere, or any segment of a sphere, and a thin, circular template, you can keep going and get any focal length you want. Of course, the above is a convex paraboloid but it works equally well on a concave one.  /   The reason why this gadget works this way lies in the equation of the pa­raboloid and the fact that every section cut from a paraboloid, like a, b, c, d, e, is a parabola and all are identical.”

A 6E5 ‘magic eye’ tube can be added without circuit complications…”  “The addition of this gadget has made a big improvement in my BC-221, and it is hoped that others will be able to derive the same benefit…”  “Needing something in a hurry to replace a smashed neon bulb as an r.f. indicator, I connected a tN34 crystal diode across a 0-1 millimeter as shown at A in Fig. 2.

<p><strong>McLuhan, Marshall, 1951.</strong> “How much more Know-How is needed to make human life obsolete?  Is there any known gadget for controlling a rampant Know-How?  The lady in the ad has found a mechanic substitute for moral choice?”  “As the ad implies, know-how is at once a technical and a moral sphere.  It is a duty for a woman to love her husband and also to love that soap that will make her husband love her.  It is a duty to be glamorous, cheerful, efficient, and, so far as possible, to run the home like an automatic factory.  This ad also draws attention to the tendency of the modern housewife, after a premarital spell in the business world, to embrace marriage and children but not housework.  Emotionally, she repudiates physical tasks with the same confection that she pursues hygiene.  And so the ad promises her a means of doing physical work without hating the husband who has dragged her into household drudgery.  /  To purchase gadgets that relieve this drudgery and thus promote domestic affection is, therefore, a duty, too.  And so it is that not only labor-saving appliances but food and nylons (‘your legs owe it to their audience’) are consumed and promoted with moral fervor.  /  But gadgets and gimmicks did not begin as physical objects, nor are they only to be understood as such today.  Benjamin Franklin, protean prototype and professor of know-how, is equally celebrated for both his material and psychological technology.  In his Autobiography, still a central feature of Yankee moral structure, he tells, for example, how he hit upon a system of moral bookkeeping which would enable any man to achieve perfection in several months.  The trick is to select only one fault at a time for deletion and by concentration and persistence the moral slate will soon be clean.  Related to this system was his discovery of various techniques for winning friends and influencing people which are still as serviceable as ever.”

Thus, by using a pan head on the tripod I have an equatorial mounting which facilitates pointing the gadget at the sun as the sun moves. This really helps.  /  “To line up the gadget, move the tar­ get until the diameter of the solar image is single and a minimum. It is well to cover either hole in the mask separately, examining the image with a low-power magnifier to note whether it is circular and whether it has a flare on one side caused by lack of squareness in the posi­tion of the target or the lens.  Clamp the binocular hinge to its support, point the gadget at the sun, and observe the images.””

<p><strong>Posnack, Emanuel R., 1951.</strong> “If a machine, apparatus, process, tool, gadget is not within the stated ‘constitutional scheme of advancing scientific knowledge’ [quoting Justice Jackson in A&amp;P decision], it is not deserving of patent protection.  It does not matter that it is new or useful–or that it has promoted the progress of the ‘useful arts’–or that it has added to human comfort or convenience–or that it has resulted in the investment of capital and the employment of labor–or in the addition of wealth.  If it adds nothing ‘to the total stock of knowledge,’ its manufacture, sale or use should not be encouraged by the special inducement of a limited patent monopoly.”

  <strong>, 1952.</strong> “Appellee-plaintiffs sued for the infringement of three patents relating to steering gear idler arm assemblies of automobiles. Appellants-defendants,2  asserted that the patents were invalid because of lack of invention and that there was no infringement. The trial court upheld validity, found and enjoined infringement, and ordered an accounting. Later Jamco was found to be in contempt for violation of the injunction.  […]  [gadgetry as commonsense solution to a problem:]  Jamco asserts that these devices do not constitute invention, were anticipated by the prior art, and at the most show only mechanical improvements which should have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art.  […]  The crucial issue is whether ‘the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.’  […]  The dividing line between what results from mechanical ability and what displays inventive genius is ill-defined. Perhaps no hard and fast definitive rule can or should be established. We have here combination patents utilizing such well and commonly known elements as bearings, grease seals, washers, bushings, nuts and bolts. In Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340 U.S. 147, 151, and 152, 71 S.Ct. 127, 129, 95 L.Ed. 162, it was said that ‘the concept of invention is inherently elusive when applied to combination of old elements’ and that ‘courts should scrutinize combination patent claims with a care proportioned to the difficulty and improbability of finding invention in an assembly of old elements.’  […] Recognizing that patentability is a question of law for the court,13  we cannot say that here there is a gadget as opposed to an invention. Certainly in a particular environment, the steering mechanism of motor vehicles, the peculiar and difficult problem of stabilizing that mechanism and protecting if from undue wear is solved in an expert, inexpensive and effective manner which attains an improved result. If the distinctive arrangement of the known elements would be apparent to a skilled mechanic, such fact is established neither by an examination of the devices nor by the evidence adduced at the trial. From the record presented to us the novel and distinctive combinations which make up the three patents in question require ‘greater skill and higher thought than would be expected of an ordinary mechanic trained in the art.’14  In the circumstances, Jamco has not sustained the burden of overcoming the presumption of validity by clear and convincing evidence.”

  <strong>Gardner, Martin, 1952.</strong> “Late in the 18th century Charles Stanhope, third Earl, a British statesman and inventor, built the first true logic machine, the Stanhope Demonstrator.  The Demonstrator was a crude gadget for solving syllogisms.  A syllogism consists of a major premise and a minor premise, the first making a statement about a “predicate term” and a “middle term,” the second about the same middle term and a “subject term.” By eliminating the middle term one arrives at the correct conclusion as to the relation of subject to predicate. In Stanhope’s Demonstrator the middle term was represented by a small wooden panel called the “holon.” It had a frame through which other panels could be slid to cover all or part of the holon. A panel of gray wood, representing the subject, was pushed in from the left, and one of red glass, representing the predicate, was pushed in over this from the right.”

There are the cavity resonator (which is used to produce high electric fields, to filter signals, to provide circuits in vacuum tubes, and so on), the magnetron and the klystron (used to produce bursts of high power, notably as pulses for radar), and a host of others.

  <strong>Roe, Anne, 1952.</strong> “The early extracurricular interests of these men were varied, but here, too, there are some general patterns. More of the physicists than of the other groups showed early interests directly related to their later occupations, but this seems quite clearly to be due to the common small-boy preoccupation in this country with physical gadgets–radio, Meccano sets and so on. The theoretical physicists were omnivorous readers, the experimentalists much less so.  […]  From fiddling with gadgets to becoming a physicist may be no great leap, but the attractions of theoretical physics are not so obvious or well known, nor are those of the social sciences or advanced biology.”

  <strong>Griffith, Maxwell, 1952.</strong> “The Gadget Maker is a 1955 novel by Maxwell Griffith. It is notable for its vivid depiction of an otherwise-rarely-described milieu: campus life at MIT in the 1940s. It also presents a striking engineers-eye-view of guided missile development at a West Coast aerospace firm during the early days of the cold war.  On its appearance, the New York Times described The Gadget Maker as “the story of a misguided zealot devoted body and soul to the advancement of knowledge” and called it “an absorbing narrative [and] a clear presentation of technological subject-matter, written with stylistic ease and fluidity by an author who is himself a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.”  Just a few phrases in the novel, such as “Essentially, engineering was the skilled bending and shaping of metals into airplanes, bridges, cars, gadgets galore.  Still, it required more than a skill at fabrication–an understanding, some vital spark of creativeness.”

  <strong>, 1952.</strong> “Your issue on automatic control is a vivid portrayal of a materialistic culture in which bright young men study engineering instead of philosophy. Only two authors (the first and last) weigh the tremendous problems that will follow the advances described by the other six. Each of these two speaks with the circumspection of one who elects to drift with the current rather than inquire too critically as to its direction.  Less inhibited philosophers–say Bertrand Russell, Karl Menninger, Julian Huxley, Henry Thoreau and Philip Wylie–have been genuinely worried that so much genius is directed at producing more and better gadgets rather than improving the aims, morals and happiness of man him­ self, a field commonly left to opportunists and superstition-mongers. Is it not cause for alarm that Nobelists in peace­ unlike those in physics or medicine­ have often been conspicuous only by their absence? Or that such a basic human urge as pride of achievement (the family piano) is steadily giving ground to pride of ownership (the family television)?”  “

They were developed by workers who wanted to attain better efficiency or greater safety on their jobs.  Perhaps you have a gadget that would be interesting to your own company.  If so, your management may be willing to consider its possible inclusion in this show so others may share its benefits.”  “Mechanical ingenuity is typical of the American worker.  From the cotton gin to the can opener he has used his inventiveness to create devices that do things more efficiently, more easily, more safely or at lower cost.  /  In an effort to further simulate such ingenuity, and also to assist in the exchange of ideas of this type, we are presenting this collection of ‘gadgets.’  /  For the most part, they are not commercially available but have been made up by the machine shops of the plants involved.  A few however have been in such demand that independent manufacturers were requested to produce and market them.  /  The Du Pont Chambers Works Safety Section and the Du Pont Wilmington Safety and Fire Protection Division were instrumental in making this collection possible.”  “

Perhaps courts, so far as possible, should leave mechanical theories to mechanics and engineers and theories on science to scientists.  There is always the chance that what may appear a subtle mechanical theory to a jurist may be obvious to even an apprentice, or what may appear to be sound science to him may be foolish to even a freshman in science.”  “parable of the raft of two logs”  “When the raft of two logs rested on the surface of the water, two natural forces were at work upon each log.  The force of gravity acting upon each log held it down upon the water and its buoyancy, responding to the law of displaced liquids, held it up.  When some force acted to overturn the raft, these two natural forces were brought into conflict, because either one log would have to rise against the law of gravity, or one would have to sink against the law of displaced liquids, before the raft could overturn.  To the extent that the two forces acted against each other, an entire new force, stability, wasp resent in the raft.  /  For good or evil, great as the invention of the atomic bomb may have been, the general invention produced no new force; it only released forces already present in nature.  /  The chieftain may only have produced a ‘gadget’ in the raft, but it still embodied a force which did not have even an incorporeal former existence.  /  Countless such forces are embodied in the mechanical devices that surround us.  Such forces are more fantastic than the fairies and genii who served favored mortals in the tales of the Arabian Nights.  Yet they are real.  They serve by the dozen in every American home, but, to legal sophisticates, the devices which embody them are only ‘gadgets.’”  Cites Reckendorfer v. Faber 1975 decision about pencil with eraser tip, and the simple, logical language used in that decision to decide whether or not a combination of two existing elements constitutes a new “force,” and ultimately a patentable invention.  Admires the simple language, written for a general public, of Justice Hunt’s decision, wishes Douglas had consulted it.  Hunt:  “The combination to be patentable must produce a different force or effect, or result in the combined forces or process, from that given by the separate parts.  There must be a new result produced by their union: if not, it is only an aggregation of old elements.”  Ends up arguing that lead pencil and attached rubber that “Not only is there no new result, but there is no joint operation.”  “

  <strong>Weaver, Warren, 1955.</strong> “I do have some familiarity with modern high speed computing devices and other optical-electronic-mechanical techniques for handling information; and I have had some contacts with–and surely a lively interest in–the recent developments of communication theory” (613).  The “patent office problem” is, to Weaver, “a fascinating instance of a rather common modern dilemma, namely, the essential collapse of a communication network due to over-complication; or somewhat more precisely, due to the use of an outmoded procedure which is not capable of coping with the presently existing degree of complication.  This is, in fact, a dramatic instance of the situation not uncommon in the general world of scholarship, in which a vast and intricate tangle of documents gets jammed into an unusable pile between two minds” (613).  “There are slightly less than three million U.S. Patents.  If we add the foreign patents and the items of technical literature available in the Patent Office, the total swells to about seven million.  The corresponding figure was only 1.2 million in 1900; and the patents of today average about one-third longer, and are certainly much more complex in their technical and scientific detail.  In the terminology of modern communications theory, in which a ‘bit’ of information is the basic unit (essentially the answer to a single ‘Yes-No’ question), the total amount of information which must today be dealt with in the Patent office has been estimated to be of the order of fifty billion bits [CONVERT 50 BILLION BITS TO GB?  1 million GB?  =  1,000 TB?] (614).  Goes on to survey different kinds of “mechanical aids to data handling.”  /  A question of classification – beginning to work out the dimensions of a relational database:  “When does a Document A exhibit inhibitory relevance to another Document B?” (619).  * * * Is it unreasonable to think that, if one just looks deep enough with trained and observant eyes, he might see an inner logical simplicity behind all the confusing proliferation of things and ideas that turn up in the Patent Office?  Just because of its emphasis on inner logical simplicity, and on generality to encompass multiplicity, the point of view of mathematics would seem to be the promising one here.  How, for example, does one ever define ‘containers’ in the everyday nouns and adjectives of commerce in a way which is at once simple enough, general enough, and critical enough so that can possibly cope with the gadgets someone will think of tomorrow?  But what object can anyone ever think up that will not be subject to the basic inner concepts of connectivity as they are developed in topology?” (621-2)  Biological metaphor for an “organic sort” of classification system, “For it must be able to grow and to adjust itself to an ever changing environment.”  (622).  “I realize that I have succeeded in defining, in impersonal terms, Professor John von Neumann; and I also realize that the Atomic Energy Commission has him all booked up at the moment.

  ** Goerger, Orville, 1955.** “Orville Goerger is Copy Director of Commerical Letter, Inc., a St. Louis mail-advertising agency.  But in addition to carrying on his regular work, he plays an important part in many ‘extracurricular activities’ that manifest his deep interest in direct mail.  He is also guest lecturer on direct-mail copy at Washington University and St. Louis University; contributor of direct-mail articles to various trade publications; creator of award-winning gadget campaigns in the Direct-mail Advertising Association’s annual competition; member of the Board of Governors, Advertising Club of St. Louis; and Chairman of the Skit-Writing Committee for the Advertising Club’s annual Gridiron Dinner” (210).  “All too often the direct-mail user planning a gadget mailing spends most of his planning time looking for a gadget that is new, different, and unusual.  /  Yet mere newness is not always a guarantee of resultfulness.  Nor is the complexity or elaborate nature of the gadget any measure of the success it will achieve.  Indeed, in many cases, best results are obtained when a relatively old idea is dug out and re-used.  /  “This may be a bit hard to believe in these days when many of the new letter gadgets rival the atom bomb in their complexity.  There are rubber-band-powered butterflies that spring out of a letter when it is opened, secret chemical processes that do magical things to a mailing piece when water is applied, Rube Goldberg mechanisms that build elaborate pop-ups when the mailing is unfolded–and literally hundreds of others.  All are ingenious and do attract a large degree of attention.  /  Yet, surprisingly enough, their effectiveness is sometimes less than that of a relatively simple gadget like, for example, a burnt match.  Both in the cost of the gadget and in the result it secures, the simple gadget frequently outscores its more expensive and elaborate brother.  /  Perhaps the reason for this is that the idea behind the gadget’s use is more important than the gadget itself [ital. in original].  In fact, a too elaborate gadget will usually overpower the copy; the reader remembers the gadget, but the message of the mailing piece may never register with him.  /  One cardinal rule for using a gadget is to keep the gadget secondary in importance to the theme of the mailing piece.  It is obviously difficult to do this when the gadget you are using is deliberately designed to dominate the mailing.  /  Another good rule for gadget usage is to keep the gadget merely a stepping stone into the copy.  A good gadget is one that provides an interesting introduction to your message; it is a master of ceremonies whose duty it is to build up the real star of the show – your copy.  A good gadget never steals the show from the star or makes that star seem insignificant by comparison.  The more sensational you make your gadget, the more difficult you make it for your copy message to hold its own.  /  Usually both of these objectives can be achieved by using a gadget or novelty effect of a simple sort.  When a simple gadget is used, you are literarily forced into developing a powerful idea for tying in your message.  In most cases a powerful idea plus the appeal of a good gadget is almost certain to click.”  The seven gadget ideas are: “a penny gadget,” literally a penny in the envelope; A piece of string, “One reason for its appeal is that it permits motion in the mailing; by fastening only one end of the string, the other end swings freely and catches the eye”;  a feather; the “burnt-edge letter,” “while not strictly a gadget, the burnt-edge letter is so dramatic and so simple that it should not be overlooked when it fits your scheme”; cotton; postage stamp, so that “people are getting something for nothing”; miniature photograph”

Bernard, 1955.</strong> “As I returned to the study MIss Dukas explained to me that Eric Rogers, who teaches physics at Princeton, had made a gadget for Einstein as a present for his 76th birthday, and that Professor Einstein had been delighted with it.  Back in  the  study,  I  saw  Einstein  take  from the  corner  of  the  room what  looked  like a  curtain  rod  five  feet  tall,  at  the  top  of which  was  a  plastic  sphere about  four inches  in diameter. Coming  up  from  the rod  into  the  sphere  was  a  small  plastic tube  about  two  inches  long,  terminating in  the  center  of  the  sphere.  Out  of  this tube there came a string with a little ball at  the  end.  “You  see,”  said  Einstein, “this  is  designed  as  a  model  to  illustrate the  equivalence  principle. The  little  ball is  attached  to  a  string,  which  goes  into the  little  tube  in  the  center  and  is  at­tached  to  a  spring.  The  spring  pulls  on the  ball,  but   it  cannot  pull the ball up and  into  the  little  tube  because  the spring  is  not  strong  enough  to  overcome the  gravitational  force which pulls down on the ball.” A  big  grin  spread  across his face  and  his  eyes  twinkled  with  delight as  he  said:  “And  now  the  equivalence principle.”  Grasping  the  gadget  in  the middle  of  the  long  brass  curtain  rod,  he thrust it upward until the sphere touched the  ceiling.  “Now  I  will  let  it  drop,”  he said,  “and  according  to  the  equivalence principle  there  will  be  no  gravitational force.  So  the  spring  will  now  be  strong enough  to  bring  the  little  ball  into  the plastic  tube.”  With  that  he  suddenly  let the  gadget  fall  freely  and  vertically, guiding it with his hand, until the bottom reached  the  floor.  The  plastic  sphere  at the  top  was  now  at  eye  level.  Sure enough, the ball nestled in the tube.”

Clipped to the end of a pencil, this little gem has has saved thousands of man-hours, and assisted in relegating ‘library script’ to the category of interesting leftovers in the card catalogs of university libraries. […] the machines and devices which are to be discussed here are those which may be regarded as simple extensions of the hander mind and which are designed to speed some operation or to relieve muscular strain, but not those intended to alter substantially the methods commonly used in libraries.  /  The common aim in introducing tools or machines into almost any process is to reduce the time or energy required to perform some operation or to produce a more uniformly satisfactory result.  To stick to this rule in the application of what may be referred to as ‘gadgets’ is sometimes difficult; many of these devices have a kind of fascination for some librarians which occasionally obscures the true economics of their application” (239).  “The popularity of gadgets is attested to by the space allotted to them in such professional journals as the A.L.A. Bulletin [the “Gadgets, Gismos, and Gimmicks” column], the Library Journal and PNLA Quarterly in the form of regular columns or departments and of articles proclaiming the success of their various applications.

  <strong>Oppenheimer, Jane, 1957.</strong> “But it may also be due to the style of the book. This  is  more  journalistic  than  literary, and sometimes the choice of words is not too  particular.  For  example,  it  quotes Samuel Butler to the effect that the “hen is  the  egg’s  device  for  laying  another egg.” Now what  Samuel  Butler  actually said,  at least in his  Life and Habit,  was something different,  namely,  that “a hen is  only  an  egg’s  way  of making  another egg.”  He  was  worrying  about  hens  not as gadgets, but as individuals. The lapse is  an interesting  one,  an intimation that in  the  authors’  minds  problems  of  in­dividuality belong to the  19th century of the  old-fashioned  nature  rather  than  to the 20th century of population  genetics. Yet the paradox remains that the fascina­tion of biology to the novice as well as to the  specialist depends even  now  on  the relationship  of  the  individual  to  his group,  and  not  on  considerations  of  the group alone.”

This was the second such effort promoted by a group of businessmen and managed by Hal Sommers, and the number of inventions aimed at simplifying everyday tasks came within a shade of doubling the total exhibited last year.  Gadgets have always held a fascination for the man on the street and his better half.  Among the items which have been surefire crowd stoppers in the past are the little gimmicks–the better mousetrap, so to speak–which show at a glance how to do something quicker and cleaner.  Some of those shown in New York, however, are a bit obscure as far as practical purpose is concerned, but they still are interesting enough to win attention.  …  The Gadget Show was initiated last year as a showplace for thousands of unknown innovations that flow from the American inventive mind.  To facilitate the marketing of practical gadgets the show management formed a Gadget Manufacturers’ Institute to counsel exhibitors in this year’s show.  It is staffed to conduct market research studies on bot consumer and trade levels, to define the potential markets for inventors and manufacturers.  The show was open to both consumers and trade.”

  <strong>, 1958.</strong> “Since considerable heat (ill-wind) can be created thru poor presentations, sloppy work and phony items, it was editable that a gadget workers’ protective organization make an appearance.  The new non-profit Exhibitors Association of America, headquartered in California, has been incorporated with the avowed aim of stopping unfair practices bothy by and against demonstrators.  It would improve the level of the demonstration industry and protect it from space rent and percentage gouging.  /  The person working gadgets is all things to all viewers, wherever the public congregates.  If they want humor he has it; the same goes for the many other qualities necessary to successful entertainment on a personnel level.  It is so personal, in fact, that unlike high paid public performers, the gadget worker’s immediate audience rarely numbers more than three dozen people and is no more than 12 feet from him.  If he is a top-notcher, however, he could get 75 per cent of his tip (audience) to vote him into Congress as easily as spring (spend) for a sale.  /  Basically speaking, the new and novel item is a traffic-stopper, enabling the demonstrator to build his tip.  He presents it in a [sic] appealing way through humor, stories, etc., hooding his tip’s attention while presenting the item.  Then comes his close (windup) and the request for sales.  Then comes a rehash of his spiel to convince additional viewers who have not sprung and also to hold the tip, which in itself is a good way to stop more traffic as passers-by gather to see what’s going on.  /  The business is a small one and far from the usual housewares salesmanship.  It has workers (commission agents) who act for the leaders, those pace-setters in the field.  There are independents, who do their own buying and renting of space, and who work alone except for an occasional partner or member of the family.  /  The field’s code of ethics is not one that a banker would follow.  It is generally a cash-on-the-line business, but it is not improper to owe money for merchandise when one is tapped out (broke), but eventual payment is a must if a worker expects to last in the industry.  Demonstrators playing a red one (successful fair date or celebration) are prone to help out another clansman by lending money or merchandise.  Credit information is entirely word of mouth, however, and reputations are soon established for honesty and reliability.  /  Altho most demonstrators work on limited capital a great deal of money can be made quickly and lost just as fast, in the trade.  Experience brings with it the ability to judge the quality and potential earnings of a location, and the knack of securing an occasional ex for gadgetry at certain fairs, on traveling shows, and at stores.  Sometimes a respected worker can control all gadget locations on a fairground by proving his competence to the fair secretary.  /  There is considerable disillusionment in the business,w which is constantly having its personnel weeded out as johnny-come-latelys fold up at the first sign of hardship.  Old-timers know, tho that rainy days soon pass, and when they do, the clan is busy at work building more tips and pocketing the profits.”

  <strong>, 1958.</strong> “the world of kitchen gadgets is never in finer fettle than during the fair season, when gadget workers have already been pulling in cash at boardwalk stands, department stores and farmers markets.  This peculiar form of gadgetry is aimed right at the women, and in the hands of capable workers, it hardly ever misses its mark.  /  During good times and bad there has always been a call for gadgets.  They make their mark, last in popularity for a cycle of three years, more or less, then seemingly die as quickly as they were born.  But this is more a hibernation than death, since in kitchen gadgetry as in many other merchandising fields, old objects are frequently born over again and ride high on a new wave of popularity.  /  For example: 20 years ago a big item on boardwalks was the combination peeler-slicer, which both peeled and cored fruit such as apples, as well as scoring corn and being useful as a slicer.  That was 20 years ago, and it’s on the scene again.  /  For example:  Three years ago, choppers became a hot item, starting with a Swiss import retailing at $1.98.  American versions, like Rotomatic and Chopomatic, competed with the Swiss Blitzhacker.  Price was $2.98.  Mass production overtook the price and stamped it down to $1.98 and even lower in some cases, causing some perplexity by price-conscious demonstrators.  Rotomatic was replaced by the Imperial Food Chopper during this period.  But this price confusion was followed by a waning popularity and it was decided to produce a super model with a bigger bowl, capable of holding more and bigger vegetables and eliminating the need to slice some of them down to chopper size.  Now we have the Grown Imperial.  /  From 1952-‘54 the handy little Mouli Grater ($1 retail) nurtured a company which has taken on a wider line of kitchen gadgets.  There is a $2.98 Julienne and $4.98 Salad-Maker (retail).  /  Others among the wide assortment of plastic and metal gizmos directed at the American housewife–and so artfully demonstrated thruout the land–include a handy radish cutter which creates a radish flowered…”  /  * * * “Gadgets used to be set out on counters in cartons, but lately the poly bag has become a common display method.  One philosophy for this is that the American housewife wants to see what she’s buying.  Some French basket suppliers provide baskets in bulk, without any covering whatever.  The basket has come up so strongly that one manufacturer, fearful of rapid over-saturation, is offering a combination package.  This contains the French basket, a pastry maker, and pastryman’s cloth.  /  But there is virtually no end to the number of handy little gadgets offered as time-savers for the American kitchen.  The target is the womenfolk and, praise be, they have responded in admirable fashion for generations, always pushovers for kitchen aids.”  Later, kinds of objects:  “inexpensive tools, ‘unbreakable combs,’ radio station clearing coils, and other inexpensive pieces of merchandise.”

  <strong>Pierce, John R., 1958.</strong> “Technological innovations have been as important as language, art and science in distinguishing man from beast.  And although technological innovation antedates our species, it has never before occupied so great a share of man’s energies.  /  Our works are built on old foundations––on obsolete inventions such as the hand-ax and the bow no less than on inventions that have survived, such as agriculture and the wheel.  But during most of human history technological art accumulated gradually.  Up to a few hundred years ago, the techniques of civilized life had scarcely advanced beyond the best achievements of the ancients.  Then our control over the forces of nature began to increase at an explosive rate.  […]  In this article we shall examine some recent advances to see what light they throw on the creative process in the complex of technology today.  What do we mean by technological innovation?  Surely not the tail fins on this year’s automobile, nor a new catch on a refrigerator door.  A true innovation must perform some important function.  It may do a wholly new job or do an old job far better or far more cheaply than it was done before.  […]  …I will discuss some reasonably noncontroversial innovations made at the Bell Telephone Laboratories, where I am employed, under circumstances which I believe I understand.  […]  As our final example of innovation in technology let us consider briefly the microwave-relay system which carries telephone conversations and television programs across the country without the use of cables.  The key word here is ‘system.’  The problem was not to make a particular device, but to weld a great number of devices into a complex whole.  Some of the deices were available at the start; others had to be developed.  But the chief innovation was the choice, among the many alternative methods and devices, of the best combination of methods and devices–the system as a whole, and not merely its adequate parts.  […]  [Harold T.] Friis’s main problem, then, was not to invent this gadget or that, but to choose the best course, technically and economically, among a bewildering array of possibilities.  The art of making such a choice is usually called systems engineering when the alternative means and the required knowledge are all at hand.  When they are not, I suppose it should be called systems research.  By 1948 the results of the research of Friis and his colleagues had been embodied in an experimental system which was installed between New York and Boston.  This was the prototype of the transcontinental microwave system, which was put into service in 1951.”

  <strong>Giovacchini, Peter L., 1959.</strong> “The ‘gadget’, which is defined by Webster as slang meaning a ‘mechanical contrivance, a device, or any ingenious article’ has become a fundamental part of the American scene.”  “One cannot generalize from the study of these two cases. The psychological mechanisms described need not be characteristic of typical cultural attitudes, although there seems generally to be something derogatory in the use of the term, gadget” (339).  “The machine deals with the external world directly and, although there are many exceptions, strives to create order from disorder. One can say that it is similar to a secondary process operation which takes the unorganized and gives it organization. In most cases a human being is required to operate machines. The gadget differs from the complex machine in that it minimizes the importance of the human being whereas the ordinary machine augments a person’s capacity to do work which requires secondary process operations. For example, typewriting is the use of a machine to record ideas which are refined and organized in the process of transmitting them to the machine. The typewriter is thus a mechanical aid to the secondary process operation. The gadget, on the other hand, requires a minimum of human intervention and gives the illusion of operating independently.  /  One cannot conceive of a machine performing secondary process operations independently, because in order to accomplish such a function there must also be a primary process. There are, however, a variety of electronic computers that seem almost to be able to think. Cybernetics, as we all know, has viewed the psychic apparatus in terms analogous to those of an electronic circuit and has caused machines to be built that function in a manner that is analogous to human logic.  /  Both patients stressed that the function of a gadget is secondary in importance to its operation, which obscured its purpose to them. Whether it worked or not, in terms of accomplishing what it is supposed to do, was a minor consideration. This does not mean that the gadget did not have to work perfectly in a mechanical sense, because if it did not the gadgeteer would be frustrated. What it did mean, to both the patients, was that the human appreciation of what the gadget accomplishes, for example, reproduction of music in such a way as to provide a gratifying and moving experience, tended to take second place in their minds to a pleasure in the operation of the gadget itself.” (336).  “Common among all the patients in this group was anger toward the gadget and the ‘gadgeteer’. To define these terms for the purpose of this paper is not easy. Any technological device, especially when first introduced, can be considered a gadget. These patients for the most part objected to two aspects of these devices which may be classified as follows. First, the regulation of time as in switches with either an automatic control or a feed-back mechanism to interrupt a circuit and turn something off or on. Included were such items as furnace controls, coffee makers, and radio switches that turn other mechanisms on and off. Second, enhancement of passivity. In this class can be included practically all objects that do work, and consequently permit more leisure. Automatic dishwashers, automatic transmissions in automobiles, and, especially, remote control of television without getting up from one’s armchair are a threat because of the enhancement of passivity.  Television itself was scorned by one patient who nevertheless succumbed to its lure and then watched it for hours every night. One patient was particularly chagrined to learn there was a switch that automatically controls a fan for ventilating a house, depending on the amount of heat in the attic. That it required a minimum of human intervention for its operation was what this patient found most disturbing.  /  This classification is sketchy and not technologically precise. As it is manifestly impossible to state definitely where invention ends and gadgeteering begins, it is striking that these patients frequently made such arbitrary distinctions. Patients pointed out that function was of little importance; the operation of the gadget was the primary feature. One patient spoke with anger of persons who were more interested in the tonal qualities of complex high fidelity sets than in the music. He referred to a recent joke of a person who contented himself with studying the wave patterns produced by an oscillograph hooked into the system.”  (330)  Catalogues patients who can only appreciate photographs and not painting for instance, appreciating technical perfection over beauty.  “In these instances, it is the person who is ingenious, not the machine; and such a person strives to be capable of accomplishing almost anything. The omnipotent qualities of such fantasies are extremely valuable in enhancing narcissism. Such a fantasy, especially when it is as compulsive as it was in both these patients, serves as a narcissistic, omnipotent, magical defense against the inner awareness of a weak and constricted ego” (339).  “To this artist, as it was to the scientist, the gadget served as an intensive means of communicating with reality.”  “In both these patients, the gadget was not only a factor that represented the operation of the secondary process, which is in opposition to instinctual forces, but, more specifically, it was a factor in preserving identity. In the first case, there was a direct correlation between the patient’s interest in gadgets and security in his identity. In the second case, there seemed to be an inverse correlation; greater preoccupation with the gadget threatened the patient’s ego ideal, and made him feel less secure of his identity.”
